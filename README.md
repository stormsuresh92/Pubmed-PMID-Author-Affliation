TI  - Vitamin E: Regulatory Redox Interactions.
PG  - 430-441
LID - 10.1002/iub.2008 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E is an essential nutrient that was discovered in the 1920s. Many of thephysiological functions of vitamin E , including its antioxidative effects , havebeen studied for nearly 100 years. Changes in redox balance induced by bothendogenously and exogenously generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involvedin various diseases , and are also a phenomenon that is considered essential forsurvival. Vitamin E is known to regulate redox balance in the body due to itshigh concentration among the lipid soluble vitamin groups , and existsubiquitously in the whole body , including cell membranes and lipoproteins.However , it has been reported that the beneficial properties of vitamin E ,including its antioxidative effects , are only displayed in vitro , and not invivo. Therefore , there exists an ongoing debate regarding the biologicalfunctions of vitamin E and its relationship with redox balance. In this review ,we introduce the relationship between vitamin E and redox interactions with (i)absorption , distribution , metabolism , and excretion of vitamin E , (ii) oxidativestress and ROS in the body , (iii) mechanism of antioxidative effects , (iv)non-antioxidant functions of vitamin E , and (v) recent recognition of the fieldof oxidative stress research. Understanding the recent findings of the redoxinteraction of vitamin E may help to elucidate the different antioxidativephenomena observed for vitamin E in vitro and in vivo. © 2019 IUBMB Life ,71(4):430-441 , 2019.

TI  - Vitamin E: Regulatory Redox Interactions.
PG  - 430-441
LID - 10.1002/iub.2008 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E is an essential nutrient that was discovered in the 1920s. Many of thephysiological functions of vitamin E , including its antioxidative effects , havebeen studied for nearly 100 years. Changes in redox balance induced by bothendogenously and exogenously generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involvedin various diseases , and are also a phenomenon that is considered essential forsurvival. Vitamin E is known to regulate redox balance in the body due to itshigh concentration among the lipid soluble vitamin groups , and existsubiquitously in the whole body , including cell membranes and lipoproteins.However , it has been reported that the beneficial properties of vitamin E ,including its antioxidative effects , are only displayed in vitro , and not invivo. Therefore , there exists an ongoing debate regarding the biologicalfunctions of vitamin E and its relationship with redox balance. In this review ,we introduce the relationship between vitamin E and redox interactions with (i)absorption , distribution , metabolism , and excretion of vitamin E , (ii) oxidativestress and ROS in the body , (iii) mechanism of antioxidative effects , (iv)non-antioxidant functions of vitamin E , and (v) recent recognition of the fieldof oxidative stress research. Understanding the recent findings of the redoxinteraction of vitamin E may help to elucidate the different antioxidativephenomena observed for vitamin E in vitro and in vivo. © 2019 IUBMB Life ,71(4):430-441 , 2019.

PG  - 671-676
LID - 10.1111/jocd.13305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin aging has many manifestations such as wrinkles , uneven skintone , and dryness. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors , especially ultravioletlight-induced oxidative radicals , contribute to the etiology of aging. Human skinrequires both water- and lipid-soluble nutrient components , including hydrophilicand lipophilic antioxidants. Vitamins C and E have important protective effectsin the aging process and require exogenous supply. Raspberry leaf extractscontain botanical actives that have the potential to hydrating and moisturizingskin. Topical products with these ingredients may therefore combine to provideimproved anti-aging effects over single ingredients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate theanti-aging and brightening effects of an encapsulated serum containing vitamin C(20% w/w) , vitamin E , and European raspberry (Rubus idaeus) leaf cell cultureextract. METHODS: Fifty female volunteers aged 30-65 years were allocated onecapsule of serum for topical application on one side of the face for 2 months , inaddition to self-use of facial skin products. Both test (treated) andcontralateral (untreated) sides were dermatologically assessed after 4 and8 weeks. Skin color (melanin index) , elasticity , radiance , moisture , and waterevaporation were measured by Mexameter MX18(®)  , Cutometer(®)  , GlossymeterGL200(®)  , Corneometer CM825(®)  , and Tewameter TM300(®) instruments ,respectively (Courage + Khazaka Electronic GmbH). Skin microtopographyparameters , smoothness (SEsm) , roughness (SEr) , scaliness (SEsc) , and wrinkles(SEw) , were measured by Visioscan(®) VC98 USB (Courage + Khazaka ElectronicGmbH) , and gross lifting effects were measured by VECTRA(®) H1 (CanfieldScientific) , and adverse reactions and satisfaction were also assessed. RESULTS:Skin color , elasticity , and radiance were significantly improved. The smoothness ,scaliness , and wrinkles were also revealed significant improvement. Mild adversereactions were tingling and tightness. CONCLUSIONS: The vitamin C , vitamin E , andraspberry leaf cell culture extract serum has anti-aging and brightening effectsof skin.

TI  - Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics of Vitamin E: Nanoformulations to EnhanceBioavailability.
PG  - 9961-9974
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S276355 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E belongs to the family of lipid-soluble vitamins and can be divided intotwo groups , tocopherols and tocotrienols , with four isomers (alpha , beta , gammaand delta). Although vitamin E is widely known as a potent antioxidant , studieshave also revealed that vitamin E possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Thesecrucial properties of vitamin E are beneficial in various aspects of health ,especially in neuroprotection and cardiovascular , skin and bone health. However ,the poor bioavailability of vitamin E , especially tocotrienols , remains a greatlimitation for clinical applications. Recently , nanoformulations that includenanovesicles , solid-lipid nanoparticles , nanostructured lipid carriers ,nanoemulsions , and polymeric nanoparticles have shown promising outcomes inimproving the efficacy and bioavailability of vitamin E. This review focuses onthe pharmacological properties and pharmacokinetics of vitamin E and currentadvances in vitamin E nanoformulations for future clinical applications. Thelimitations and future recommendations are also discussed in this review.

AB  - Vitamin E , a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant , found in higher concentration inimmune cells compared to other cells in blood , is one of the most effectivenutrients known to modulate immune function. Vitamin E deficiency has beendemonstrated to impair normal functions of the immune system in animals andhumans , which can be corrected by vitamin E repletion. Although deficiency israre , vitamin E supplementation above current dietary recommendations has beenshown to enhance the function of the immune system and reduce risk of infection ,particularly in older individuals. The mechanisms responsible for the effect ofvitamin E on the immune system and inflammation have been explored in cell-based ,pre-clinical and clinical intervention studies. Vitamin E modulates T cellfunction through directly impacting T cell membrane integrity , signaltransduction , and cell division , and also indirectly by affecting inflammatorymediators generated from other immune cells. Modulation of immune function byvitamin E has clinical relevance as it affects host susceptibility to infectiousdiseases such as respiratory infections , in addition to allergic diseases such asasthma. Studies examining the role of vitamin E in the immune system havetypically focused on α-tocopherol; however , emerging evidence suggests that otherforms of vitamin E , including other tocopherols as well as tocotrienols , may alsohave potent immunomodulatory functions. Future research should continue toidentify and confirm the optimal doses for individuals at different life stage ,health condition , nutritional status , and genetic heterogeneity. Future researchshould also characterize the effects of non-α-alpha-tocopherol vitamin E onimmune cell function as well as their potential clinical application. © 2018IUBMB Life , 71(4):487-494 , 2019.

AB  - Vitamin E or tocopherol is a fat-soluble vitamin that functions as anantioxidant , protecting the cell membrane. As with all vitamins , the body doesnot form vitamin E. It solely forms from the photosynthetic processes of plantsand therefore must be consumed from outside sources in small quantities. VitaminE is a medication used to manage and treat vitamin E deficiency states anddisease prevention. This activity outlines the indications , action , adversereactions , contraindications , and other key elements of vitamin E therapy in theclinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of aninterprofessional team managing the care of patients with vitamin E deficiencyand applications of vitamin E in disease prevention.

TI  - The Effect of Vitamin E Supplementation on Serum Aminotransferases inNon-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/nu15173733 [doi]
LID - 3733
AB  - Νon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of end-stage liverdisease in developed countries. Oxidative stress plays a key role during thecourse of the disease and vitamin E supplementation has shown to be beneficialdue to its antioxidative properties. We aim to investigate the effect of vitaminE supplementation on serum aminotransferase levels in patients with NAFLD. Threeelectronic databases (MEDLINE , CENTRAL , and Embase) were reviewed for randomizedtrials that tested vitamin E supplementation versus placebo or no intervention inpatients with NAFLD , published until April 2023. A total of 794 patients from 12randomized trials were included in this meta-analysis. Notwithstanding thestudies' heterogeneity and moderate internal validity in certain cases , amongstudies testing vitamin E supplementation at 400 IU/day and above , the values ofalanine aminotransferase (ALT) were reduced compared with placebo or nointervention [ALT Mean Difference (MD) = -6.99 IU/L , 95% CI (-9.63 , -4.35) , forstudies conducted in Asian countries and MD = -9.57 IU/L , 95% CI (-12.20 , -6.95)in non-Asian countries]. Regarding aspartate aminotransferase (AST) , patients inthe experimental group experienced a reduction in serum levels , though smaller inabsolute values [AST MD = -4.65 IU/L , 95% CI (-7.44 , -1.86) in studies conductedin Asian populations] and of lower precision in non-Asian studies [MD = -5.60IU/L , 95% CI (-11.48 , 0.28)].

TI  - New Insights into the Pathogenesis of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease:Gut-Derived Lipopolysaccharides and Oxidative Stress.
LID - 10.3390/nu12092762 [doi]
LID - 2762
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liverdisease worldwide. The intricate NAFLD pathogenesis is summarized by themultiple-hits hypothesis , which combines all the environmental and geneticfactors that promote the development of NAFLD into a single scenario. Amongthese , bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are derived from the overgrowth ofGram-negative bacteria and translocated mainly as a consequence of enhancedintestinal permeability. Furthermore , oxidative stress is increased in NAFLD as aconsequence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and a shortage ofendogenous antioxidant molecules , and it is promoted by the interaction betweenLPS and the Toll-like receptor 4 system. Interestingly , oxidative stress , whichhas previously been described as being overexpressed in cardiovascular disease ,could represent the link between LPS and the increased cardiovascular risk inNAFLD subjects. To date , the only effective strategy for the treatment of NAFLDand non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the loss of at least 5% body weightin overweight and/or obese subjects. However , the dose-dependent effects ofmultispecies probiotic supplementation on the serum LPS level and cardiometabolicprofile in obese postmenopausal women were demonstrated. In addition , manyantibiotics have regulatory effects on intestinal microbiota and were able toreduce serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) , alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ,and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in NASH animal models. Regarding theoxidant status , a Mediterranean diet has been reported to reduce oxidant stress ,while vitamin E at high daily dosages induced the resolution of NASH in 36% oftreated patients. Silymarin had the positive effect of reducing transaminaselevels in NAFLD patients and long-term treatment may also decrease fibrosis andslow liver disease progression in NASH. Finally , the influence of nutraceuticalson gut microbiota and oxidant stress in NAFLD patients has not yet been wellelucidated and there are insufficient data either to support or refuse their usein these subjects.

TI  - Abetalipoproteinemia.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Abetalipoproteinemia typically presents in infancy withfailure to thrive , diarrhea , vomiting , and malabsorption of fat. Hematologicmanifestations may include acanthocytosis (irregularly spiculated erythrocytes) ,anemia , reticulocytosis , and hemolysis with resultant hyperbilirubinemia.Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A , D , E , and K) can result in an increasedinternational normalized ratio (INR). Untreated individuals may develop atypicalpigmentation of the retina that may present with progressive loss of night visionand/or color vision in adulthood. Neuromuscular findings in untreated individualsincluding progressive loss of deep tendon reflexes , vibratory sense , andproprioception; muscle weakness; dysarthria; and ataxia typically manifest in thefirst or second decades of life. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis ofabetalipoproteinemia is established in a proband with absent or extremely lowLDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels and biallelicpathogenic variants in MTTP identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Adequate caloric intake to alleviate growthdeficiency; low-fat diet (10%-20% of total calories from fat); oral essentialfatty acid supplementation (up to 1 teaspoon per day of oils rich inpolyunsaturated fatty acids , as tolerated); supplementation with vitamin A(100-400 IU/kg/day) , vitamin D (800-1,200 IU/day) , vitamin E (100-300 IU/kg/day) ,and vitamin K (5-35 mg/week). Mild anemia rarely requires treatment , althoughoccasionally vitamin B(12) or iron therapy may be considered. Dysarthria , ataxia ,and hypothyroidism are treated in the standard fashion. Prevention of primarymanifestations: Most complications can be prevented through institution of alow-fat diet with supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins (A , D , E , and K).Surveillance: Assessment of growth parameters at each visit. Complete bloodcount , INR , reticulocyte count , liver function tests (AST , ALT , GGT , total anddirect bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , and albumin) , fat-soluble vitamin levels(vitamin A [retinol] , 25-OH vitamin D , and plasma or red blood cell vitamin Econcentrations) , serum calcium , serum phosphate , serum uric acid , and TSH levelsannually. Lipid profile (total cholesterol , triglyceride concentration ,LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , apo B , and apo A-I) every several years.Ultrasound of the liver every three years. Ophthalmology and neurologyevaluations every six to 12 months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fatty foods ,particularly those rich in long-chain fatty acids. Evaluation of relatives atrisk: Sibs of a proband should undergo a full lipid profile and apolipoprotein(apo) B determination to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of findings. Ifthe pathogenic MTTP variants in the family are known , molecular genetic testingmay also be used to determine the genetic status of at-risk sibs. In classicabetalipoproteinemia , affected sibs will present shortly after birth with failureto thrive , diarrhea , vomiting , and malabsorption of fat. Pregnancy management:Vitamin A excess can be harmful to the developing fetus. Therefore , women who arepregnant or who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their vitamin Asupplement dose by 50%. Additionally , close monitoring of serum beta carotenelevels throughout pregnancy is recommended. Because vitamin A is an essentialvitamin , vitamin A supplementation should not be discontinued during pregnancy.GENETIC COUNSELING: Abetalipoproteinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessivemanner. At conception , each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance ofbeing affected , a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier , and a 25% chanceof being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives andprenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic MTTPvariants in the family are known.

TI  - Vitamin E Deficiency.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Vitamin E is all the following eight compounds alpha , beta , gamma , anddelta-tocopherol and alpha , beta , gamma , and delta-tocotrienol. Alpha-tocopherolis the only compound of the eight that are known to meet human dietary needs. Allof the vitamin E forms are absorbed in the small intestine , and then the livermetabolizes only alpha-tocopherol. The liver then removes and excretes theremaining vitamin E forms. Vitamin E deficiency is extremely rare in humans as itis unlikely caused by a diet consisting of low vitamin E. Rather , it tends to becaused by irregularities in dietary fat absorption or metabolism. Vitamin E is alipid-soluble nutrient. Vitamin E may have a role in reducing atherosclerosis andlowering rates of ischemic heart disease. Premature infants have low vitamin Ereserves due to vitamin E only able to cross the placenta in small amounts.

TI  - Vitamin E Toxicity.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Vitamin E is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant obtained exclusively from thediet. It was discovered in the 1920s as an essential dietary element required byrats for reproduction. There are approximately eight different vitamin E-relatedmolecules , but the dominant molecule in humans is alpha-tocopherol. Tocotrienolsare the other molecules that are widely studied for vitamin E supplementation.These two molecules have been studied in various dosages and for many differenthealth purposes. Vitamin E has peroxyl radical scavenger properties. Whilevitamin E toxicity is associated with an increased risk of bleeding , itsdeficiency has been associated with neurologic diseases and anemia.

TI  - Chylomicron Retention Disease.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Chylomicron retention disease (CMRD) , characterized bythe inability to secrete chylomicrons from the enterocytes following theingestion of fat , typically presents in infancy with failure to thrive , diarrhea ,vomiting , abdominal distention , and malabsorption of fat. This leads tosteatorrhea – the severity of which relates to the fat content of the diet – andin some cases , hepatomegaly. Organ systems outside of the gastrointestinal tractmay also be affected (often due to malnutrition and deficiencies of fat-solublevitamins) , including neuromuscular abnormalities (typically in the first orsecond decade of life) secondary to vitamin E deficiency , poor bonemineralization and delayed bone maturation due to vitamin D deficiency , prolongedinternational normalized ratio (INR) due to vitamin K deficiency , mildophthalmologic issues (e.g. , micronystagmus , delayed dark adaptation , abnormalvisual evoked potentials , and abnormal scotopic electroretinograms) , and (in asmall proportion of adults) cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction.Affected individuals typically have marked hypocholesterolemia , low plasmaapolipoprotein B levels , normal-to-low plasma triglyceride levels , and low serumconcentrations of fat-soluble vitamins (A , D , E , and K). Endoscopy typicallydemonstrates a gelée blanche ("white hoar frosting") appearance of the duodenalmucosa. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The molecular diagnosis of CMRD is established in aproband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in SAR1Bidentified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations:Ensure adequate caloric intake with a low-fat diet (<30% of total calories fromfat) enriched in essential fatty acids with or without medium-chaintriglycerides; high-dose oral fat-soluble vitamins , including vitamin E(hydrosoluble form) 50 IU/kg/d , vitamin A 15,000 IU/d , vitamin K 15 mg/week , andvitamin D 800-1200 IU/d; consider adding IV vitamin supplementation if anindividual is late to be diagnosed with neurologic complications , althoughbenefit is not proven in this situation; standard treatment for deficits in nightvision and/or color vision , ataxia , and cardiomyopathy. Surveillance: Annually:measurement of growth parameters; evaluation of digestive and neurologicsymptoms; assessment of dietary fat content/compliance; and measurement of lipidprofile , liver function tests , complete blood count , INR , and vitamins A , D , andE. Every three years after age ten: liver ultrasound , neurologic exam with serumcreatine kinase and electromyography , ophthalmologic evaluation , and DXA scan.Every three to five years in adults: echocardiogram with assessment of ejectionfraction. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoidance of fatty foods , particularlythose rich in long-chain fatty acids. Pregnancy management: Vitamin A excess canbe harmful to the developing fetus. Therefore , women who are pregnant or who areplanning to become pregnant should reduce their vitamin A supplement dose by 50%.Additionally , close monitoring of serum vitamin A levels throughout pregnancy isrecommended. GENETIC COUNSELING: CMRD is inherited in an autosomal recessivemanner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a SAR1B pathogenicvariant , each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance ofbeing affected , a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier , and a 25% chanceof inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the SAR1Bpathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member , carriertesting for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testingare possible.

AB  - AIM: To identify and discuss the efficacy of dietary interventions , antioxidantsupplementation , physical activity , and nutritional and psychologic counseling inthe treatment of children and adolescents with non alcoholic fatty liver diseaseassociated with obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review of studies onnutritional and educational interventions and physical activity in pediatricpatients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease was conducted. A search forrandomized clinical trials or quasi-experimental studies published up to December2017 was carried out , utilizing seven databases (Medline , EBSCO , OVID , ScienceDirect , JSTOR , Wiley , and Biblioteca Digital UDG). RESULTS: From a total of 751articles , 729 were excluded due to the criteria of age , design , language ,diagnostic method , and outcome variables. The analysis included 22 articles. Themost frequently used intervention variables were diet and physical activity. Theinterventions had different durations , but most were carried out for one year.Some authors employed ascorbic acid , vitamin E , or omega-3 fatty acidsupplementation. There were varying degrees of improvement in the variablesanalyzed in the majority of the studies , such as a decrease in ALT levels , areduced frequency of steatosis determined through imaging studies , and a decreasein body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary interventions , omega-3 fatty acidsupplementation , physical activity , and nutritional and psychologic counselingwere identified as efficacious measures in the treatment of non alcoholic fattyliver disease associated with obesity in children and adolescents , according tobiochemical or imaging study indicators , within the time frame of theintervention.

AB  - Defects in intestinal epithelial tight junctions (TJs) allow paracellularpermeation of noxious luminal antigens and are important pathogenic factors ininflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We show that alpha-tocopherylquinone (TQ) , aquinone-structured oxidation product of vitamin E , consistently enhances theintestinal TJ barrier by increasing barrier-forming claudin-3 (CLDN3) andreducing channel-forming CLDN2 in Caco-2 cell monolayers (in vitro) , mouse models(in vivo) , and surgically resected human colons (ex vivo). TQ reduces colonicpermeability and ameliorates colitis symptoms in multiple colitis models. TQ ,bifunctionally , activates both aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factorerythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways. Genetic deletion studies revealthat TQ-induced AhR activation transcriptionally increases CLDN3 via xenobioticresponse element (XRE) in the CLDN3 promoter. Conversely , TQ suppresses CLDN2expression via Nrf2-mediated STAT3 inhibition. TQ offers a naturally occurring ,non-toxic intervention for enhancement of the intestinal TJ barrier and adjuncttherapeutics to treat intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a common cause of drug-induced acute liverfailure. Although hepatocyte cell death is considered to be the critical event inAPAP-induced hepatotoxicity , the underlying mechanism remains unclear.Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death that is caused by a loss ofcellular redox homeostasis. As glutathione (GSH) depletion triggers APAP-inducedhepatotoxicity , we investigated the role of ferroptosis in a murine model ofAPAP-induced acute liver failure. APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (evaluated in termsof ALT , AST , and the histopathological score) , lipid peroxidation (4-HNE andMDA) , and upregulation of the ferroptosis maker PTGS2 mRNA were markedlyprevented by the ferroptosis-specific inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Fer-1treatment also completely prevented mortality induced by high-dose APAP.Similarly , APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and lipid peroxidation were prevented bythe iron chelator deferoxamine. Using mass spectrometry , we found that lipidperoxides derived from n-6 fatty acids , mainly arachidonic acid , were elevated byAPAP , and that auto-oxidation is the predominant mechanism of APAP-derived lipidoxidation. APAP-induced hepatotoxicity was also prevented by genetic inhibitionof acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 or α-tocopherolsupplementation. We found that ferroptosis is responsible for APAP-inducedhepatocyte cell death. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism ofAPAP-induced hepatotoxicity and suggest that ferroptosis is a potentialtherapeutic target for APAP-induced acute liver failure.

TI  - APOB-Related Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with biallelic APOB-related familialhypobetalipoproteinemia (APOB-FHBL) may present from infancy through to adulthoodwith a range of clinical symptoms including deficiency of fat-soluble vitaminsand gastrointestinal and neurologic dysfunction. Affected individuals typicallyhave plasma total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and apo B levels below the fifthcentile for age and sex. Acanthocytosis , elevated liver enzymes , andhyperbilirubinemia may also be found. The most common clinical findings arehepatomegaly , steatorrhea , and failure to thrive / growth deficiency. In theabsence of treatment , affected individuals can develop atypical pigmentation ofthe retina; progressive loss of deep tendon reflexes , vibratory sense , andproprioception; muscle pain or weakness; dysarthria; ataxia; tremors; andsteatohepatitis , fibrosis , and rarely , cirrhosis of the liver. Individuals with aheterozygous , typically truncating pathogenic variant in APOB are usuallyasymptomatic with mild liver dysfunction and hepatic steatosis. However , about5%-10% of individuals with heterozygous APOB-FHBL develop relatively more severenonalcoholic steatohepatitis requiring medical attention and occasionallyprogressing to cirrhosis , albeit very rarely. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis ofbiallelic APOB-related familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (APOB-FHBL) orheterozygous APOB-FHBL is established in a proband with either biallelic or aheterozygous pathogenic variant(s) , respectively , in APOB identified by moleculargenetic testing MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Individuals withbiallelic APOB-FHBL: low-fat diet (<30% of total calories) while ensuringadequate caloric intake; high-dose oral fat-soluble vitamin supplementation(vitamin E: 100-300 IU/kg/day; vitamin A: 100-400 IU/kg/day; vitamin D: 800-1200IU/day; vitamin K: 5-35 mg/week); consideration of oral essential fatty acidsupplementation; liver transplantation may be considered for those with end-stageliver disease; standard treatment for ataxia , dysarthria , and loss of nightand/or color vision and scotomas; no treatment is typically required foranemia/hemolysis. Individuals with heterozygous APOB-FHBL: no treatment typicallyrequired. Prevention of primary manifestations: Adoption of a low-fat diet (<30%of total calories) and high-dose oral fat-soluble vitamin supplementation mayameliorate or prevent clinical features of APOB-FHBL. Surveillance: Individualswith biallelic APOB-FHBL: measurement of growth parameters and assessment for newor progressive signs/symptoms of gastrointestinal issues every 6-12 months;laboratory studies to include lipid profile , liver function tests , vitaminlevels , INR , calcium , phosphorus , uric acid , CBC , vitamin B(12) , folate and TSHevery 1-2 years; ophthalmology evaluation and neurologic examination every 6-12months after age 10 years; hepatic ultrasound and bone mineral densitometrystudies every 3-5 years after age 10 years. Individuals with heterozygousAPOB-FHBL: laboratory studies to include lipid profile and liver function testsevery 1-2 years; hepatic ultrasound every 3 years after age 10 years in thosewith elevated liver transaminases. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Individualswith biallelic APOB-FHBL should avoid fatty foods. No dietary restrictions aretypically required for those with heterozygous APOB-FHBL. Evaluation of relativesat risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparentlyasymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an individual with biallelicAPOB-FHBL in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit fromprompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Evaluations can include afull lipid profile (including apo B concentration) and/or molecular genetictesting for the APOB pathogenic variant(s) identified in the proband. Pregnancymanagement: Vitamin A excess can be harmful to the developing fetus. Therefore ,women who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant should reduce theirvitamin A supplement dose by 50%. Additionally , close monitoring of serum vitaminA levels throughout pregnancy is recommended. Because vitamin A is an essentialvitamin , however , vitamin A supplementation for affected women should not bediscontinued during pregnancy. GENETIC COUNSELING: APOB-related familialhypobetalipoproteinemia (APOB-FHBL) caused by homozygous (or compoundheterozygous) pathogenic variants in APOB is inherited in an autosomal recessivemanner. At conception , each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance ofbeing affected , a 50% chance of being heterozygous for APOB-FHBL and havinglaboratory findings and (rarely) clinical features , and a 25% chance of beingunaffected and not a heterozygote. Heterozygote testing for at-risk relatives andprenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic APOBvariants in the family are known.

AB  - Vitamin E , also known as tocochromanol , is a lipid-soluble antioxidant that canonly be produced by photosynthetic organisms in nature. Vitamin E is not onlyessential in human diets , but also required for plant environment adaptions. Tosynthesize vitamin E , specific prenyl groups needs to be incorporated withhomogentisate as the first step of reaction. After decades of studies , an almostcomplete roadmap has been revealed for tocochromanol biosynthesis pathway.However , chlorophyll-derived prenyl precursors for synthesizing tocochromanolsare still a mystery. In recent years , by employing forward genetic screening andgenome-wide-association approaches , significant achievements were acquired instudying vitamin E. In this review , by summarizing the recent progresses invitamin E , we provide to date the most updated whole view of vitamin Ebiosynthesis pathway. Also , we discussed about the role of vitamin E in plantsstress response and its potential as signaling molecules.

LID - 310
AB  - Vitamin E is one of the most popular fat-soluble vitamins in pathologicalresearch and has been under scrutiny since the 1980s as a vital dietary componentof food. The antioxidant effect of vitamin E has been widely studied due to itsbenefits in the prevention of various cardiovascular diseases. In recent years ,alternative effects of vitamin E , in terms of anti-inflammatory pathways and generegulation , have also been of interest to researchers. This review examines therole of dietary vitamin E (α-tocopherol) as an antioxidant and bioactive moleculein promoting vascular health. While the antioxidant effect of vitamin E is wellestablished , knowledge about its capacity as a promising regulatory molecule inthe control of the vascular system is limited. The aim of this review is todiscuss some of these mechanisms and summarize their role in the prevention ofcardiovascular diseases (CVD). Here , we also briefly discuss foods rich invitamin E , and deliberate some potential toxicological effects of excessivesupplemental vitamin E in the body.

TI  - Vitamin E: Regulatory role of metabolites.
PG  - 479-486
LID - 10.1002/iub.1988 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E plays an important role as a lipophilic antioxidant in cellular redoxhomeostasis. Besides this function , numerous non-antioxidant properties of thisvitamin have been discovered in the past. DNA microarray technology revealed acomplex regulatory network influenced by the different vitamin E forms (Rimbachet al. , Molecules , 15 , 1746 (2010); Galli et al. , Free Radic. Biol. Med. , 102 , 16(2017)); however , little is known about the biological activity of vitamin Emetabolites. A new chapter of vitamin E research was been opened when endogenouslong-chain tocopherol metabolites were identified and their high biologicalactivity in vitro and in vivo was recognized (Schmölz et al. , World J. Biol.Chem. , 7 , 14 (2016); Torquato et al. , J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. , 124 , 399 (2016)).Just recently , it was shown that an endogenous metabolite of vitamin E inhibits5-lipoxygenase at nanomolar concentrations , thereby limiting inflammation (Peinet al. , Nat. Commun. , 9 , 3834 (2018)). Furthermore , long-chain vitamin Emetabolites (LCM) exhibit hormone-like activities similar to the lipid solublevitamins A and D (Galli et al. , Free Radic. Biol. Med. , 102 , 16 (2017); Schubertet al. , Antioxidants , 7 (2018)). This review aims at summarizing recent findingson the regulatory activities of vitamin E metabolites , especially of LCMs. © 2018IUBMB Life , 71(4):479-486 , 2019.

TI  - Novel Multi-Ingredient Supplement Facilitates Weight Loss and Improves BodyComposition in Overweight and Obese Individuals: A Randomized , Double-Blind ,Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.
LID - 10.3390/nu15173693 [doi]
LID - 3693
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the growing recognition of the obesity crisis , its ratescontinue to rise. The current first-line therapies , such as dietary changes ,energy restriction , and physical activity , are typically met with poor adherence.Novel nutritional interventions can address the root causes of obesity , includingmitochondrial dysfunction , and facilitate weight loss. OBJECTIVE: The objectiveof this study was to investigate the effects of a multi-ingredient nutritionalsupplement designed to facilitate mitochondrial function and metabolic healthoutcomes over a 12 wk period. METHODS: Fifty-five overweight and/or obeseparticipants (age (mean ± SEM): 26 ± 1; body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)): 30.5 ±0.6) completed this double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participantswere randomized to 12 wks of daily consumption of multi-ingredient supplement(MIS; n = 28; containing 50 mg forskolin , 500 mg green coffee bean extract , 500mg green tea extract , 500 mg beet root extract , 400 mg α-lipoic acid , 200 IUvitamin E , and 200 mg CoQ10) or control placebo (PLA , n = 27; containingmicrocrystalline cellulose) matched in appearance. The co-primary outcomes werebodyweight and fat mass (kg) changes. The secondary outcomes included other bodycomposition measures , plasma markers of obesity , fatty liver disease biomarkers ,resting energy metabolism , blood pressure , physical performance , and quality oflife. The post-intervention differences between MIS and PLA were examined viaANCOVA which was adjusted for the respective pre-intervention variables. RESULTS:After adjustment for pre-intervention data , there was a significant difference inweight (p < 0.001) and fat mass (p < 0.001) post-intervention between the PLA andMIS treatment arms. Post-intervention weight and fat mass were significantlylower in MIS. Significant post-intervention differences corrected for baselinewere found in markers of clinical biochemistry (AST , p = 0.017; ALT , p = 0.008) ,molecular metabolism (GDF15 , p = 0.028) , and extracellular vesicle-associatedmiRNA species miR-122 and miR-34a in MIS (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Following the12 wks of MIS supplementation , weight and body composition significantlyimproved , concomitant with improvements in molecular markers of liver health andmetabolism.

TI  - Encapsulation of Lipid-Soluble Bioactives by Nanoemulsions.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25173966 [doi]
LID - 3966
AB  - Lipid-soluble bioactives are important nutrients in foods. However , theiraddition in food formulations , is often limited by limited solubility and hightendency for oxidation. Lipid-soluble bioactives , such as vitamins A , E , D and K ,carotenoids , polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and essential oils are generallydispersed in water-based solutions by homogenization. Among the differenthomogenization technologies available , nanoemulsions are one of the mostpromising. Accordingly , this review aims to summarize the most recent advances innanoemulsion technology for the encapsulation of lipid-soluble bioactives. Modernapproaches for producing nanoemulsion systems will be discussed. In addition , thechallenges on the encapsulation of common food ingredients , including thephysical and chemical stability of the nanoemulsion systems , will be alsocritically examined.

TI  - Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) Metabolism and Nutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease.
LID - 10.3390/antiox11050989 [doi]
LID - 989
AB  - Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is an essential micronutrient and fat-solubleantioxidant with proposed role in protecting tissues from uncontrolled lipidperoxidation. This vitamin has also important protein function and genemodulation effects. The metabolism of vitamin E depends on hepatic bindingproteins that selectively retain food alpha-tocopherol for incorporation intonascent VLDL and tissue distribution together with esterified cholesterol andtriglycerides. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition of oxidative stressand increased lipid peroxidation , that are associated with alterations ofalpha-tocopherol metabolism and function. Specific changes have been reported forthe levels of its enzymatic metabolites , including both short-chain andlong-chain metabolites , the latter being endowed with regulatory functions onenzymatic and gene expression processes important for the metabolism of lipidsand xenobiotics detoxification , as well as for the control of immune andinflammatory processes. Vitamin E therapy has been investigated in CKD using bothoral vitamin E protocols and vitamin E-coated hemodialyzers , showing promisingresults in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease , as well as ofimmune and hematological complications. These therapeutic approaches are reviewedin the present article , together with a narrative excursus on the main findingsindicating CKD as a condition of relative deficiency and impaired metabolism ofvitamin E.

TI  - The Link between NAFLD and Metabolic Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13040614 [doi]
LID - 614
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by an association of cardiovascularand diabetes mellitus type 2 risk factors. Although the definition of MetSslightly differs depending on the society that described it , its centraldiagnostic criteria include impaired fasting glucose , low HDL-cholesterol ,elevated triglycerides levels and high blood pressure. Insulin resistance (IR) isbelieved to be the main cause of MetS and is connected to the level of visceralor intra-abdominal adipose tissue , which could be assessed either by calculatingbody mass index or by measuring waist circumference. Most recent studies revealedthat IR may also be present in non-obese patients , and considered visceraladiposity to be the main effector of MetS' pathology. Visceral adiposity isstrongly linked with hepatic fatty infiltration also known as non-alcoholic fattyliver disease (NAFLD) , therefore , the level of fatty acids in the hepaticparenchyma is indirectly linked with MetS , being both a cause and a consequenceof this syndrome. Taking into consideration the present pandemic of obesity andits tendency to drift towards a progressively earlier onset due to the Westernlifestyle , it leads to an increased NAFLD incidence. Novel therapeutic resourcesare lifestyle intervention with physical activity , Mediterranean diet , ortherapeutic surgical respective metabolic and bariatric surgery or drugs such asSGLT-2i , GLP-1 Ra or vitamin E. NAFLD early diagnosis is important due to itseasily available diagnostic tools such as non-invasive tools: clinical andlaboratory variables (serum biomarkers): AST to platelet ratio index , fibrosis-4 ,NAFLD Fibrosis Score , BARD Score , fibro test , enhanced liver fibrosis;imaging-based biomarkers: Controlled attenuation parameter , magnetic resonanceimaging proton-density fat fraction , transient elastography (TE) or vibrationcontrolled TE , acoustic radiation force impulse imaging , shear wave elastography ,magnetic resonance elastography; and the possibility to prevent itscomplications , respectively , fibrosis , hepato-cellular carcinoma or livercirrhosis which can develop into end-stage liver disease.

This study examinedwhether ingesting a liposomal multivitamin and mineral supplement (MVM)differentially affects the appearance and/or clearance of vitamins and mineralsin the blood compared to a non-liposomal MVM supplement. In a double-blind ,randomized , and counterbalanced manner , 34 healthy men and women fasted for 12 h.Then , they ingested a non-liposomal (NL) or liposomal (L) MVM supplement and astandardized snack. Venous blood samples were obtained at 0 , 2 , 4 , and 6 h afterMVM ingestion and analyzed for a panel of vitamins and minerals. Plasma levels ofvitamins and minerals and mean changes from baseline with 95% confidenceintervals (CIs) were analyzed using general linear model statistics with repeatedmeasures. The observed values were also entered into pharmacokinetic analysissoftware and analyzed through univariate analysis of variance with repeatedmeasure contrasts. The results revealed an overall treatment x time interactioneffect among the vitamins and minerals evaluated (p = 0.051 , ηp2 = 0.054 ,moderate effect). Differences between treatments were also observed in volumedistribution area (vitamin E , iron) , median residence time (vitamin E , iron) ,volume distribution area (iron) , volume of distribution steady state (vitamin A ,E , iron) , clearance rates (vitamin A , E) , elimination phase half-life (vitamin E ,iron) , distribution/absorption phase intercept (vitamin A) , anddistribution/absorption phase slope and rate (vitamin C , calcium). Vitamin volumedistribution was lower with liposomal MVM ingestion than non-liposomal MVMsources , suggesting greater clearance and absorption since similar amounts ofvitamins and minerals were ingested. These findings indicate that coating a MVMwith liposomes affects individual nutrient pharmacokinetic profiles. Additionalresearch should evaluate how long-term supplementation of liposomal MVMsupplements may affect vitamin and mineral status , nutrient function , and/orhealth outcomes.

TI  - Vitamin E Supplementation and Mitochondria in Experimental and FunctionalHyperthyroidism: A Mini-Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu11122900 [doi]
LID - 2900
AB  - Mitochondria are both the main sites of production and the main target ofreactive oxygen species (ROS). This can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction withharmful consequences for the cells and the whole organism , resulting in metabolicand neurodegenerative disorders such as type 2 diabetes , obesity , dementia , andaging. To protect themselves from ROS , mitochondria are equipped with anefficient antioxidant system , which includes low-molecular-mass molecules andenzymes able to scavenge ROS or repair the oxidative damage. In the mitochondrialmembranes , a major role is played by the lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin E ,which reacts with the peroxyl radicals faster than the molecules ofpolyunsaturated fatty acids , and in doing so , protects membranes from excessiveoxidative damage. In the present review , we summarize the available dataconcerning the capacity of vitamin E supplementation to protect mitochondria fromoxidative damage in hyperthyroidism , a condition that leads to increasedmitochondrial ROS production and oxidative damage. Vitamin E supplementation tohyperthyroid animals limits the thyroid hormone-induced increases inmitochondrial ROS and oxidative damage. Moreover , it prevents the reduction ofthe high functionality components of the mitochondrial population induced byhyperthyroidism , thus preserving cell function.

AB  - Selenium is connected to three small molecule antioxidant compounds , ascorbate ,α-tocopherol , and ergothioneine. Ascorbate and α-tocopherol are true vitamins ,while ergothioneine is a "vitamin-like" compound. Here we review how selenium isconnected to all three. Selenium and vitamin E work together as a team to preventlipid peroxidation. Vitamin E quenches lipid hydroperoxyl radicals and theresulting lipid hydroperoxide is then converted to the lipid alcohol byselenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase. Ascorbate reduces the resultingα-tocopheroxyl radical in this reaction back to α-tocopherol with concomitantproduction of the ascorbyl radical. The ascorbyl radical can be reduced back toascorbate by selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductase. Ergothioneine andascorbate are both water soluble , small molecule reductants that can reduce freeradicals and redox-active metals. Thioredoxin reductase can reduce oxidized formsof ergothioneine. While the biological significance of this is not yet realized ,this discovery underscores the centrality of selenium to all three antioxidants.

TI  - Benzodiazepines for the Treatment of Seizure Clusters.
PG  - 125-140
LID - 10.1007/s40263-023-01060-1 [doi]
AB  - Patients with epilepsy may experience seizure clusters , which are described bythe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as intermittent , stereotypic episodesof frequent seizure activity that are distinct from a patient's usual seizurepattern. Untreated seizure clusters may increase the risk for status epilepticus ,as well as decrease quality of life and increase burden on patients and carepartners. Benzodiazepine therapies are the mainstay for acute treatment ofseizure clusters and are often administered by nonmedical care partners outside ahealthcare facility. Three rescue therapies are currently FDA-approved for thisindication , with diazepam rectal gel being the first in 1997 , for patients aged ≥ 2 years. Limitations of rectal administration (e.g. , positioning and disrobingthe patient , which may affect ease of use and social acceptability; interpatientvariation in bioavailability) led to the investigation of the potential for nasaladministration as an alternative. Midazolam nasal spray (MDS) was approved by theFDA in 2019 for patients aged ≥  12 years and diazepam nasal spray (DNS) in 2020for patients aged ≥  6 years; these two intranasal therapies have differences intheir formulations [e.g. , organic solvents (MDS) vs. Intravail and vitamin E forabsorption and solubility (DNS)] , effectiveness (e.g. , proportion of seizureclusters requiring only one dose) , and safety profiles. In clinical studies , theproportion of seizure clusters for which only one dose of medication was usedvaried between the three approved rescue therapies with the highest single-doserate for any time period for DNS; however , although studies for all threepreparations enrolled patients with highly intractable epilepsy , inclusion andexclusion criteria varied , so the three cannot be directly compared. Treatmentsthat have been used off-label for seizure clusters in the USA include midazolamfor injection as an intranasal spray (indicated for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesiaand anesthesia) and tablet forms of clonazepam (indicated for treatment forseizure disorders) and lorazepam (indicated for anxiety). In the European Union ,buccal and intranasal midazolam are used for treating the indication ofprolonged , acute convulsive seizures and rectal diazepam solution for theindication of epileptic and febrile convulsions; duration of effectiveness forthese medications for the treatment of seizure clusters has not been established.This paper examines the literature context for understanding seizure clusters andtheir treatment and provides effectiveness , safety , and administration detailsfor the three FDA-approved rescue therapies. Additionally , other medications thatare used for rescue therapy in the USA and globally are discussed. Finally , thepotential benefits of seizure action plans and candidates for their use areaddressed. This paper is intended to provide details about the uniquecharacteristics of rescue therapies for seizure clusters to help clarifyappropriate treatment for individual patients.

TI  - Vitamin E TPGS-Based Nanomedicine , Nanotheranostics , and Targeted Drug Delivery:Past , Present , and Future.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics15030722 [doi]
LID - 722
AB  - It has been seventy years since a water-soluble version of vitamin E calledtocophersolan (also known as TPGS) was produced; it was approved by USFDA in 1998as an inactive ingredient. Drug formulation developers were initially intriguedby its surfactant qualities , and gradually it made its way into the toolkit ofpharmaceutical drug delivery. Since then , four drugs with TPGS in theirformulation have been approved for sale in the United States and Europe includingibuprofen , tipranavir , amprenavir , and tocophersolan. Improvement andimplementation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for disease aregoals of nanomedicine and the succeeding field of nanotheranostics. Specifically ,imaging and treating tumors with nanohybrid theranostics shows promisingpotential. Docetaxel , paclitaxel , and doxorubicin are examples of poorlybioavailable therapeutic agents; hence , much effort is applied for developingTPGS-based nanomedicine , nanotheranostics , and targeted drug delivery systems toincrease circulation time and promote the reticular endothelial escape of thesedrug delivery systems. TPGS has been used in a number of ways for improving drugsolubility , bioavailability improvement , and prevention of drug efflux from thetargeted cells , which makes it an excellent candidate for therapeutic delivery.Through the downregulation of P-gp expression and modulation of efflux pumpactivity , TPGS can also mitigate multidrug resistance (MDR). Novel materials suchas TPGS-based copolymers are being studied for their potential use in variousdiseases. In recent clinical trials , TPGS has been utilized in a huge number ofPhase I , II , and III studies. Additionally , numerous TPGS-based nanomedicine andnanotheranostic applications are reported in the literature which are in theirpreclinical stage. However , various randomized or human clinical trials have beenunderway for TPGS-based drug delivery systems for multiple diseases such aspneumonia , malaria , ocular disease , keratoconus , etc. In this review , we haveemphasized in detail the review of the nanotheranostics and targeted drugdelivery approaches premised on TPGS. In addition , we have covered varioustherapeutic systems involving TPGS and its analogs with special references to itspatent and clinical trials.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence in the brain of amyloidplaques formed by the aberrant deposition of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Sincemany vitamins are dysregulated in this disease , we explored whether thesemolecules contribute to the protein homeostasis system by modulating Aβaggregation. By screening 18 fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamin metabolites ,we found that retinoic acid and α-tocopherol , two metabolites of vitamin A andvitamin E , respectively , affect Aβ aggregation both in vitro and in aCaenorhabditis elegans model of Aβ toxicity. We then show that the effects ofthese two vitamin metabolites in specific combinations cancel each other out ,consistent with the "resilience in complexity" hypothesis , according to which thecomplex composition of the cellular environment could have an overall protectiverole against protein aggregation through the simultaneous presence of aggregationpromoters and inhibitors. Taken together , these results indicate that vitaminscan be added to the list of components of the protein homeostasis system thatregulate protein aggregation.

TI  - Vitamin E: Regulatory Role on Signal Transduction.
PG  - 456-478
LID - 10.1002/iub.1986 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E modulates signal transduction pathways by several molecular mechanisms.As a hydrophobic molecule located mainly in membranes it contributes togetherwith other lipids to the physical and structural characteristics such as membranestability , curvature , fluidity , and the organization into microdomains (lipidrafts). By acting as the main lipid-soluble antioxidant , it protects other lipidssuch as mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA , respectively)against chemical reactions with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS andRNS , respectively) and prevents membrane destabilization and cellulardysfunction. In cells , vitamin E affects signaling in redox-dependent andredox-independent molecular mechanisms by influencing the activity of enzymes andreceptors involved in modulating specific signal transduction and gene expressionpathways. By protecting and preventing depletion of MUFA and PUFA it indirectlyenables regulatory effects that are mediated by the numerous lipid mediatorsderived from these lipids. In recent years , some vitamin E metabolites have beenobserved to affect signal transduction and gene expression and their relevancefor the regulatory function of vitamin E is beginning to be elucidated. Inparticular , the modulation of the CD36/FAT scavenger receptor/fatty acidstransporter by vitamin E may influence many cellular signaling pathways relevantfor lipid homeostasis , inflammation , survival/apoptosis , angiogenesis ,tumorigenesis , neurodegeneration , and senescence. Thus , vitamin E has animportant role in modulating signal transduction and gene expression pathwaysrelevant for its uptake , distribution , metabolism , and molecular action that whenimpaired affect physiological and patho-physiological cellular functions relevantfor the prevention of a number of diseases. © 2018 IUBMB Life , 71(4):456-478 ,2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering antioxidant effects of vitamin E (Vit E) , in the presentstudy , the effect of Vit E on liver and kidney functions and oxidative stressparameters in tissues of these organs of hypothyroid (Hypo) rats were reported.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals were included in three groups:(1) control , (2)hypo , and (3) hypo-hypo-Vit E. Hypothyroidism was induced in rats by giving 0.05%propylthiouracil (PTU) in drinking water. Besides PTU , the rats in group 3 weredaily injected with Vit E (20 mg/kg) for 42 days. The animals were deeplyanesthetized and sacrificed , and the serum of the rats was immediately removed tomeasure thyroxin level and subsequent analysis. The liver and kidney tissues werealso immediately removed for biochemical oxidative stress criteria. RESULTS: PTUadministration reduced serum thyroxin level and also thiol content , superoxidedismutase (SOD) , and catalase (CAT) activities in the liver and kidney tissueswhile increasing malondialdehyde (MDA). Hypothyroidism also increased alanineaminotransferase (ALT) , blood urea nitrogen (BUN) , and creatinine whiledecreasing albumin. Vit E increased thiol , SOD , and CAT in the liver and kidneytissues while diminished MDA. Vit E also decreased ALT , BUN , and creatinine whileincreased albumin. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that Vit Eprevented liver and renal tissue damage in hypothyroid rats.

AB  - Alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential nutrient that functions as a majorlipid-soluble antioxidant in humans. The alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP)binds α-tocopherol with high affinity and selectivity and regulates whole-bodydistribution of the vitamin. Heritable mutations in the TTPA gene result infamilial vitamin E deficiency , elevated indices of oxidative stress , andprogressive neurodegeneration that manifest primarily in spinocerebellar ataxia.Although the essential role of vitamin E in neurological health has beenrecognized for over 50 years , the mechanisms by which this essential nutrient istransported in the central nervous system are poorly understood. Here we foundthat , in the murine cerebellum , TTP is selectively expressed in glial fibrillaryacidic protein-positive astrocytes , where it facilitates efflux of vitamin E toneighboring neurons. We also show that induction of oxidative stress enhances thetranscription of the TtpA gene in cultured cerebellar astrocytes. Furthermore ,secretion of vitamin E from astrocytes is mediated by an ABC-type transporter ,and uptake of the vitamin into neurons involves the low-density lipoproteinreceptor-related protein 1. Taken together , our data indicate that TTP-expressingastrocytes control the delivery of vitamin E from astrocytes to neurons , and thatthis process is homeostatically responsive to oxidative stress. These are thefirst observations that address the detailed molecular mechanisms of vitamin Etransport in the central nervous system , and these results have importantimplications for understanding the molecular underpinnings of oxidativestress-related neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Activity of Vitamin E Homologues: In Vitro Study.
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070608 [doi]
LID - 608
AB  - Here we present comparative data on the inhibition of lipid peroxidation by avariety of tocochromanols in liposomes. We also show for the first time thepotential neuroprotective role of all the vitamin E homologues investigated onthe neuronally differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. α-Tocopherolhad nearly no effect in the inhibition of lipid peroxidation , while β- , γ- , andδ-tocopherols inhibited the reaction completely when it was initiated in a lipidphase. Similar effects were observed for tocotrienol homologues. Moreover , inthis respect plastochromanol-8 was as effective as β- , γ- , and δ-tocochromanols.When the prenyllipids were investigated in a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)test and incorporated into different lipid carriers , the radical oxidation wasmost pronounced in liposomes , followed by mixed micelles and the micellar system.When the reaction of tocochromanols was examined in niosomes , the oxidation wasmost pronounced for α-tocopherol and plastochromanol-8 , followed byα-tocotrienol. Next , using retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells , we testedthe protective effects of the compounds investigated on hydrogen peroxide(H(2)O(2))-induced cell damage. We showed that tocotrienols were more active thantocopherols in the oxidative stress model. Plastochromanol-8 had a stronginhibitory effect on H(2)O(2)-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release andH(2)O(2)-induced decrease in cell viability. The water-soluble α-tocopherolphosphate had neuroprotective effects at all the concentrations analyzed. Theresults clearly indicate that structural differences between vitamin E homologuesreflect their different biological activity and indicate their potentialapplication in pharmacological treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. In thisrespect , the application of optimal tocochromanol-carrying structures might becritical.

LID - e15616
AB  - Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin and an antioxidant that prevents theperoxidation of lipid in vitro. The antioxidant role of vitamin E in preventingadverse cardiovascular outcomes is controversial as some studies support it ,while others reject it. Therefore , this review aims to determine whether there isan association between vitamin E and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Anelectronic search was done to find out relevant articles. Papers were shortlistedafter the initial title and abstract screen. A full-text study was done , andinclusion and exclusion criteria were applied before the quality assessment ofeach paper was done. Only high-quality papers were selected for analysis.Full-text articles of the last ten years were included , while non-Englisharticles , gray literature , and animal studies were excluded. The majority of thepapers , including 75% of the total population in this review , suggested no roleof vitamin E in preventing CVD and CVD mortality. Some studies also suggestedthat a high level of vitamin E can be associated with adverse cardiovascularoutcomes. Thus , one should be prudent about taking vitamin E supplementation forcardiovascular risk prevention.

TI  - Nutrient Patterns and Risk of Osteopenia in Postmenopausal Women.
LID - 10.3390/nu15071670 [doi]
LID - 1670
AB  - Nutrient patterns (NPs) and the synergistic effect between nutrients have beenshown to be associated with changes in bone mineral density (BMD). This studyaimed to identify NPs and to associate them with BMD categories in postmenopausalwomen. This cross-sectional , observational , analytical study was carried out withwomen in menopause for at least 12 months , aged ≥50 years. Sociodemographic ,lifestyle , and clinical variables were investigated. BMD was assessed using dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry. A dietary assessment was conducted using a foodfrequency questionnaire , and three nutrient patterns (NP1 , NP2 , and NP3) wereextracted from the principal component analysis. Multivariate logistic regressionwas applied to investigate the association between BMD classifications and NPconsumption. A total of 124 women , aged on average , 66.8 ± 6.1 years , wereevaluated. Of these , 41.9% had osteopenia and 36.3% had osteoporosis. The NP1(OR: 6.64 , [CI95%: 1.56-28.16]; p = 0.010) , characterized by vitamin B12 ,pantothenic acid , phosphorus , riboflavin , protein (total and animal) , vitamin B6 ,potassium , vitamin D , vitamin E , calcium , cholesterol , β-carotene , omega 3 ,magnesium , zinc , niacin , and selenium; and the NP2 (OR: 5.03 , [CI95%:1.25-20.32]; p = 0.023) , characterized by iron , vegetable protein , thiamine ,folate , fibers (soluble and insoluble) , PUFA , vitamin A , vitamin K ,alpha-tocopherol , copper , sodium , and retinol , was inversely associated withosteopenia. The lower consumption of NP1 and NP2 by postmenopausal women wasassociated with a higher risk of osteopenia , but not osteoporosis.

TI  - Vitamin E intestinal absorption: Regulation of membrane transport across theenterocyte.
PG  - 416-423
LID - 10.1002/iub.1955 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E is an essential molecule for our development and health. It has longbeen thought that it was absorbed and transported through cellular membranes by apassive diffusion process. However , data obtained during the past 15 years showedthat its absorption is actually mediated , at least in part , by cholesterolmembrane transporters including the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) ,CD36 molecule (CD36) , NPC1-like transporter 1 (NPC1L1) , and ATP-binding cassettesA1 and G1 (ABCA1 and ABCG1). This review focuses on the absorption process ofvitamin E across the enterocyte. A special attention is given to the regulationof this process , including the possible competition with other fat-solublemicronutrients , and the modulation of transporter expressions. Overall , recentresults noticeably increased the comprehension of vitamin E intestinal transport ,but additional investigations are still required to fully appreciate themechanisms governing vitamin E bioavailability. © 2018 IUBMB Life , 71(4):416-423 ,2019.

TI  - Changes in the Mitochondria in the Aging Process-Can α-Tocopherol Affect Them?
LID - 10.3390/ijms241512453 [doi]
LID - 12453
AB  - Aerobic organisms use molecular oxygen in several reactions , including those inwhich the oxidation of substrate molecules is coupled to oxygen reduction toproduce large amounts of metabolic energy. The utilization of oxygen isassociated with the production of ROS , which can damage biological macromoleculesbut also act as signaling molecules , regulating numerous cellular processes.Mitochondria are the cellular sites where most of the metabolic energy isproduced and perform numerous physiological functions by acting as regulatoryhubs of cellular metabolism. They retain the remnants of their bacterialancestors , including an independent genome that encodes part of their proteinequipment; they have an accurate quality control system; and control of cellularfunctions also depends on communication with the nucleus. During aging ,mitochondria can undergo dysfunctions , some of which are mediated by ROS. In thisreview , after a description of how aging affects the mitochondrial quality andquality control system and the involvement of mitochondria in inflammation , wereport information on how vitamin E , the main fat-soluble antioxidant , canprotect mitochondria from age-related changes. The information in this regard isscarce and limited to some tissues and some aspects of mitochondrial alterationsin aging. Improving knowledge of the effects of vitamin E on aging is essentialto defining an optimal strategy for healthy aging.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) , a highly lethal form of adult malignant gliomas with littleclinical advancement , raises the need for alternative therapeutic approaches.Lipid-soluble vitamins have gained attention in malignant brain tumors owing totheir pleiotropic properties and their anti-cancer potential have been reportedin a number of human GBM cell lines. The aim of this paper is to systematicallyreview and describe the roles of various biomarkers regulated by lipid-solublevitamins , such as vitamins A , D , E , and K , in the pathophysiology of GBM.Briefly , research articles published between 2005 and 2021 were systematicallysearched and selected from five databases (Scopus , PubMed , Ovid MEDLINE , EMBASEvia Ovid , and Web of Science) based on the study's inclusion and exclusioncriteria. In addition , a number of hand-searched research articles identifiedfrom Google Scholar were also included for the analysis. A total of 40differentially expressed biomarkers were identified from the 19 eligible studies.The results from the analysis suggest that retinoids activate celldifferentiation and suppress the biomarkers responsible for stemness in human GBMcells. Vitamin D appears to preferentially modulate several cell cyclebiomarkers , while vitamin E derivatives seem to predominantly modulate biomarkersrelated to apoptosis. However , vitamin K1 did not appear to induce anysignificant changes to the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling or apoptotic pathways in humanGBM cell lines. From the systematic analysis , 12 biomarkers were identified thatmay be of interest for further studies , as these were modulated by one or two ofthese lipid-soluble vitamins.

AB  - Fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A , D , E , and K) assume a pivotal role inmaintaining human homeostasis by virtue of their enzymatic functions. The dailyinclusion of these vitamins is imperative to the upkeep of various physiologicalprocesses including vision , bone health , immunity , and protection againstoxidative stress. Current research highlights fat-soluble vitamins as potentialtherapeutics for human diseases , especially cancer. Fat-soluble vitamins exerttheir therapeutic effects through multiple pathways , including regulation ofmatrix metalloproteinases' (MMPs) expression and enzymatic activity. As MMPs havebeen reported to be involved in the pathology of various diseases , such ascancers , cardiovascular diseases , and neurological disorders , regulating theexpression and/or activity of MMPs could be considered as a potent therapeuticstrategy. Here , we summarize the properties of fat-soluble vitamins and theirpotential as promising candidates capable of effectively modulating MMPs throughmultiple pathways to treat human diseases.

AB  - Advancements in respiratory and nutrition management have significantly improvedthe survival of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). With the availability ofseveral nutrition interventions such as oral/enteral nutrition supplements ,enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes , and water-miscible CF-specific vitaminsupplements , frank vitamin deficiencies-with the exception of vitamin D-arerarely encountered in current clinical practice. Whereas they were previouslyconsidered as micronutrients , our current understanding of fat-soluble vitaminsand minerals as antioxidants , immunomodulators , and disease biomarkers has beenevolving. The impact of highly effective modulators on the micronutrient statusof patients with CF remains elusive. This narrative review focuses on the updateson the management of fat-soluble vitamins and other micronutrients in CF in thecurrent era and identifies the gaps in our knowledge.

TI  - Vitamin E Analog Trolox Attenuates MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease in Mice ,Mitigating Oxidative Stress , Neuroinflammation , and Motor Impairment.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24129942 [doi]
LID - 9942
AB  - Trolox is a potent antioxidant and a water-soluble analog of vitamin E. It hasbeen used in scientific studies to examine oxidative stress and its impact onbiological systems. Trolox has been shown to have a neuroprotective effectagainst ischemia and IL-1β-mediated neurodegeneration. In this study , weinvestigated the potential protective mechanisms of Trolox against a1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's diseasemouse model. Western blotting , immunofluorescence staining , and ROS/LPO assayswere performed to investigate the role of trolox against neuroinflammation , theoxidative stress mediated by MPTP in the Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model(wild-type mice (C57BL/6N) , eight weeks old , average body weight 25-30 g). Ourstudy showed that MPTP increased the expression of α-synuclein , decreasedtyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in the striatumand substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) , and impaired motor function. However ,Trolox treatment significantly reversed these PD-like pathologies. Furthermore ,Trolox treatment reduced oxidative stress by increasing the expression of nuclearfactor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Lastly ,Trolox treatment inhibited the activated astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba-1) ,also reducing phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB , (p-NF-κB) and tumor necrosisfactor-alpha (TNF-α) in the PD mouse brain. Overall , our study demonstrated thatTrolox may exert neuroprotection on dopaminergic neurons against MPTP-inducedoxidative stress , neuroinflammation , motor dysfunction , and neurodegeneration.

PG  - 356-369
LID - 10.1024/0300-9831/a000590 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E is a lipid soluble antioxidant which mainly circulates as α-tocopherolin the human plasma. Its deficiency is associated with ataxia , neuropathy ,anaemia and several other health conditions. Although substantial data on vitaminE status has been published worldwide , there is paucity of data on the extent ofdeficiency from most Asian countries , including India. Part of the problem islack of validated biomarkers for vitamin E and no consensus on cut offs fordefining deficiency and sufficiency. Thus , interpretation of the data on thevitamin E status is difficult. Limited available data from 31 studies on vitaminE status in healthy people from Asia , the most populated continent , has beencollated for the purpose of this review. Broadly , the results suggest inadequatevitamin E status in most age groups , with the prevalence of deficiency reaching67% , 80% , 56% and 72% in infants , children and adolescents , adults , elderly andpregnant women , respectively , based on varying cut offs. The findings are notsurprising as both , vitamin E intakes and its status have not received too muchattention in the past. Lack of conclusive data accentuates the need for moreresearch on the vitamin E status across all age groups and to define age , genderand physiological state specific cut offs for vitamin E levels.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent liverdisease worldwide. Despite its high prevalence and rising incidence , there arecurrently no specific targeted pharmacotherapies approved by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Current therapiesfor patients with NAFLD include lifestyle modification. Vitamin E andpioglitazone are recommended for those confirmed to have NASH. However , there areconcerns about the long-term safety of both pioglitazone and vitamin E in higherdoses. Metformin is essential for managing the abnormal metabolic parameters inpatients with NAFLD. Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue , sodium-dependent glucosecotransporter inhibitors , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonistshave shown benefits in improving metabolic parameters and reducing hepatic lipidaccumulation and inflammation. However , the role of these antidiabetic agents inspecifically reversing NASH needs to be established. Indeed , statins have beenunderprescribed in patients with NASH owing to fear of hepatotoxicity despitecoronary artery disease being a common cause of death in patients with NAFLD.Statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patientswith NASH and dyslipidemia. However , their use specifically for treatment of NASHneeds further evaluation. Optimizing the control of risk factors remains the mainstrategy for treatment until targeted pharmacotherapies for NASH are available.

AB  - Vitamin E comprises compounds consisting of a chromanol ring and an isoprenoidside-chain , and is an essential lipid-soluble nutrient with several physiologicalfunctions. Vitamin E intake has been reported as inadequate for some populations.Only a fraction of dietary vitamin E is effectively released from the food matrix(bioaccessible fraction) , absorbed (enterocyte uptake/epithelial transport) andtransported in lipoproteins to reach the target tissues (bioavailable fraction) ,depending on the food structure , composition , and processing. Therefore , researchconcerning the fate of vitamin E through the gastrointestinal tract is ofparamount importance for developing healthy foods and guiding effective publicpolicies. The combination of simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestionfollowed by intestinal epithelial transport and/or enterocyte uptake assays usingex vivo cell models has been successfully used to mimic the physiologicalconditions and predict the bioaccessibility and epithelial transport ofcompounds. The objective of this review was to summarize the current knowledgeand challenges for predicting the bioaccessibility and uptake/epithelialtransport of vitamin E by in vitro and ex vivo assays. Here , we revisited themetabolism of vitamin E and introduced in vitro and ex vivo methods forestimating the bioaccessibility and intestinal absorption of vitamin E. Thisreview compiles data on vitamin E bioaccessibility in vitro and uptake/epithelialtransport ex vivo for different food matrices , and discusses the factors that canaffect their measurement. Additionally , co-culture approaches using hepaticlineages to assess vitamin E bioavailability are further presented.

AB  - In molecular biology research , a vitamin E (VE) vehicle (VE dissolved in organicsolvent) is often added to water media without a stabilizer. However , thedetailed behavior of VE colloids in water media is unclear. In this study , wereveal that VE nanoemulsion readily forms in water-based media through theexisting protocol. The colloid size was changed from 39 nm to the submicron scaleby adjusting the initial concentration of the VE solution and adding a buffer.The radical scavenging effect of the dispersed nanosized VEs is comparable tothat of the water-soluble antioxidant Trolox , providing excellent antioxidantperformance in colloid form. The cytoprotection effect of the VE colloids under alipid oxidation condition largely depends on the size of the nanodispersion.Smaller dispersed particles are more efficient radical scavengers than largerparticles for a constant VE amount owing to sophisticated uptake behavior ofcell. This unveiled fundamental knowledge pave the way for a preparative protocolof stabilizer-free VE vehicles , which are expected to become widely used inmolecular biology research.

AB  - This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of post-transportation vitamin E(VE) supplementation on health condition , blood biochemical parameters , bloodantioxidant indices and blood metabolomics in yak. Five yaks were used in thisstudy. After 2100 km of highway transportation from Riwoqe county to RongchangCounty , Chongqing , blood was collected immediately after arrival and thesesamples served as the baseline (control , CON_VE). A VE injection (40 mg/kg) wasthen performed and blood samples were collected 10 days later. Injection of VEled to lower serum VE concentration. Relative to the CON_VE , VE injection led togreater concentrations of creatinine and lower concentrations of glutamatepyruvic transaminase , alkaline phosphatase , aspartate aminotransferase , totalbilirubin , indirect bilirubin , direct bilirubin , UREA and glucose. Compared withCON_VE , VE injection led the lower serum level of malondialdehydeand greaterserum level of glutathione s-transferase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathionereductase and glutathione peroxidase 4. Based on metabolomics analysis , 119differentially altered serum metabolites (P<0.05 and VIP>1.0) were identifiedwith VE injection relative to CON_VE. VE injection resulted in changes oflysophosphatidylethanolamine , lysophosphatidylcholine , phosphocholine , choline ,malate , citrate , α-Oxo-glutarate , phenylalanine , 3-Phenylpropanoic acid and3-(3-Hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid. These metabolites are associated with lipidmetabolism , tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative stress. Overall , our studyindicates that VE injection can alleviate transportation stress in yak partlythrough protecting liver and kidney , and improving antioxidant defense systems.

AB  - Prevention of neurodegeneration during aging , and support of optimal brainfunction throughout the lifespan , requires protection of membrane structure andfunction. We review the synergistic action of different classes of dietarymicronutrients , as well as further synergistic contributions from exercise andstress reduction , in supporting membrane structure and function. We addressmembrane-associated inflammation involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) thatproduce immune regulators from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of membranephospholipids. The potential of dietary micronutrients to maintain membranefluidity and prevent chronic inflammation is examined with a focus onsynergistically acting membrane-soluble components (zeaxanthin , lutein , vitaminE , and omega-3 PUFAs) and water-soluble components (vitamin C and variousphenolics). These different classes of micronutrients apparently operate in aseries of intertwined oxidation-reduction cycles to protect membrane function andprevent chronic inflammation. At this time , it appears that combinations of abalanced diet with regular moderate exercise and stress-reduction practices areparticularly beneficial. Effective whole-food-based diets include theMediterranean and the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention forNeurodegenerative Delay diet , where DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to StopHypertension).

AB  - The aim of the current meta-analysis was to assess the effects of vitamin E onclinical outcomes in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The current meta-analysis was planned , reported , and conducted per the guidelinesof the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) statement. Two authors systematically searched for all papers usingPubMed, Cochrane Central Register , and Embase from inception to October 15 , 2022.Outcomes assessed in the current meta-analysis included changes in alaninetransaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) from baseline in IU/L. Otheroutcomes included a change in BMI (kg/cm2) , a change in total cholesterol levelfrom baseline (mg/l) , and a fibrosis score. Total articles were included in thecurrent meta-analysis , enrolling 569 patients (274 patients in the vitamin Egroup and 295 in the placebo group). The study found that reduction in ALTlevels , AST levels , and BMI was significantly greater in patients in the vitaminE group compared to the placebo group. However , no significant differences werereported in terms of change in fibrosis score and total cholesterol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT) is the critical enzyme for thebiosynthesis of tocopherols (vitamin E) , which are the major lipid-solubleantioxidants and help plants adapt to various stress conditions. HPT is generallystrictly conserved in various plant genomes; however , a divergent lineage HPT2was identified recently in some Triticeae species. The molecular function andtranscriptional profiles of HPT2 remain to be characterized. RESULTS: In thisstudy , we performed comprehensive transcriptome data mining of HPT1 and HPT2 indifferent tissues and stages of barley (Hordeum vulgare) , wheat (Triticumaestivum) , and oat (Avena sativa) , followed by qRT-PCR experiments on HPT1 andHPT2 in different tissues of barley and wheat. We found that the common HPT1genes (HvHPT1 , TaHPT1s , and AsHPT1s) displayed a conserved transcriptionalpattern in the three target species and were universally transcribed in varioustissues , with a notable preference in leaf. In contrast , HPT2 genes (HvHPT2 ,TaHPT2 , and AsHPT2) were specifically transcribed in spike (developmentallyup-regulated) and shoot apex tissues , displaying a divergent tissue-specificpattern. Cis-regulatory elements prediction in the promoter region identifiedcommon factors related to light- , plant hormone- , low temperature- , drought- anddefense- responses in both HPT1s and HPT2s. We observed the transcriptionalup-regulation of HvHPT1 and HvHPT2 under various stress conditions , supportingtheir conserved function in environmental adaption. We detected a clear , relaxedselection pressure in the HPT2 lineage , consistent with the predicted evolutionpattern following gene duplication. Protein structural modelling and substratedocking analyses identified putative catalytic amino acid residues for HvHPT1 andHvHPT2 , which are strictly conserved and consistent with their function invitamin E biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the presence of two lineages ofHPT in Triticeae and Aveninae , including hexaploid oat , and characterized theirtranscriptional profiles based on transcriptome and qRT-PCR data. HPT1s wereubiquitously transcribed in various tissues , whilst HPT2s were highly expressedin specific stages and tissue. The active transcription of HPT2s , together withits conserved cis-elements and protein structural features , support HPT2s' rolein tocopherol production in Triticeae. This study is the first protein structuralanalysis on the membrane-bound plant HPTs and provides valuable insights into itscatalytic mechanism.

AB  - Vitamin E (VE) is an essential fat-soluble nutrient for dairy cows. Vitamin Edeficiency leads to immune suppression and oxidative stress and increases thesusceptibility of cows to reproductive disorders in the early post-partum period.However , studies on plasma proteomics of VE deficiency have not been reported sofar. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to understand the changes of bloodprotein profile in cows with subclinical VE deficiency in the early post-partumperiod. In this study , plasma protein levels of 14 healthy cows (>4 μg/mlα-tocopherol) and 13 subclinical VE-deficient cows (2-3 μg/ml α-tocopherol) wereanalyzed by tandem mass tag (TMT). The results showed that there were 26differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the plasma of cows with subclinicalVE deficiency compared with healthy controls. Twenty-one kinds of proteins weredownregulated , and five kinds were upregulated , among which eight proteins inprotein-protein interactions (PPI) network had direct interaction. These proteinsare mainly involved in the MAPK signaling pathway , pantothenic acid and coenzymeA (CoA) biosynthesis , PPAR signaling pathway , and glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchor biosynthesis. The top four DEPs in PPI (APOC3 , APOC4 , SAA4 , PHLD)and one important protein (VNN1) by literature review were further verified byELISA and Western blot. The expression levels of APOC3 , VNN1 , and SAA4 weresignificantly lower than those of healthy controls by ELISA. VNN1 wassignificantly lower than those of healthy controls by Western blot. VNN1 isclosely related to dairy cow subclinical VE deficiency and can be a potentialbiomarker. It lays a foundation for further research on the lack of pathologicalmechanism and antioxidative stress of VE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to systematically review the effects of maternalvitamin and/or mineral supplementation on the content of breast milk. METHODS: Wesystematically searched electronic databases including Medline via PubMed , Scopusand ISI Web of Science till May 24 , 2018. The following terms were usedsystematically in all mentioned databases: ("human milk" OR "breast milk" OR"breast milk composition" OR "human breast milk composition" OR "compositionbreast milk" OR "mother milk" OR "human breast milk" OR "maternal milk") AND("vitamin a" OR "retinol" OR "retinal" OR "retinoic acid" OR "beta-carotene" OR"beta carotene" OR "ascorbic acid" OR "l-ascorbic acid" OR "l ascorbic acid" OR"vitamin c" OR "vitamin d" OR "cholecalciferol" OR "ergocalciferol" OR"calciferol" OR "vitamin e" OR "tocopherol" OR "tocotrienol" OR"alpha-tocopherol" OR "alpha tocopherol" OR "α-tocopherol" OR "α tocopherol" OR"vitamin k" OR "vitamin b" OR "vitamin b complex" OR "zinc" OR "iron" OR "copper"Or "selenium" OR "manganese" OR "magnesium") and we searched Medline via Medicalsubject Headings (MeSH) terms. We searched Google Scholar for to increase thesensitivity of our search. The search was conducted on human studies , but it wasnot limited to the title and abstract. Methodological quality and risk of bias ofincluded studies were evaluated by Jadad scale and Cochrane risk of bias tools ,respectively. RESULTS: This review included papers on three minerals (zinc , iron ,selenium) and 6 vitamins (vitamin A , B , D , C , E and K) in addition tomulti-vitamin supplements. Although studies had different designs , e.g. not usingrandom allocation and/or blinding , our findings suggest that maternal use of somedietary supplements , including vitamin A , D , vitamin B1 , B2 and vitamin C mightbe reflected in human milk. Vitamin supplements had agreater effect on breastmilk composition compared to minerals. Higher doses of supplements showed highereffects and they were reflected more in colostrum than in the mature milk.CONCLUSION: Maternal dietary vitamin and/or mineral supplementation , particularlyfat- soluble vitamins , vitamin B1 , B2 and C might be reflected in the breast milkcomposition. No difference was found between mega dose and single doseadministration of minerals.

AB  - A Vitamin or mineral supplement is a kind of adjunct that aims to supplement thediet and it comprises a wide range of Vitamins , minerals , herbs , etc. , thatamplifies different nutrient levels. People intake such supplements forprotection against health illnesses such as stress , cold , flu , osteoporosis ,heart attacks , tooth decay , cancer , and neural tube defects in infants , etc.Anyhow , intake of large amounts without proper medical consideration can havesevere negative consequences. This study aimed to assess the awareness on Vitaminand mineral supplements among College students. An online cross-sectionalquestionnaire was made using Google Forms and distributed among 100 Collegestudents. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS software. Descriptiveanalysis and Chi-square tests were done. Results showed that the majority of63.43% of UG students and 21.64% of PG students believed that its consumption wasbeneficial and in general awareness was more among UG students. When asked aboutthe Vitamin that should be avoided during pregnancy , a majority of 20.30% of UGstudents opted for Vitamin E and 7.52% of PG students opted for Vitamin A whichshows that both were feasible options as they were fat-soluble vitamins capableof causing congenital defects. The most probable issue related with the use ofdietary supplements is that the people who include them in their diet might seeit as a substitute , in lieu of a supplement , thus , more people should be madeaware of the proper consumption and side effects of Vitamin and mineralsupplements.

TI  - Experimental and molecular docking studies of quercetin and vitamin E withdiabetes-associated mitochondrial-ATPase as anti-apoptotic therapeuticstrategies.
PG  - 1717-1729
LID - 10.1007/s40200-022-01132-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Researches have shown the relevance of antioxidants in the management ofseveral diseases. In the present study , the effects of quercetin and vitamin Ewere investigated on the mitochondrial functions in vivo and in silico. METHODS:Structures of quercetin and vitamin E were docked against mitochondrial Adenosinetriphosphatase (mATPase) , and cytochrome c cavity. Activity of liver mATPase andmitochondrial permeability transition pore opening were determined byspectrophotometry and activation of cytochrome c was examined byimmunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The binding energy of vitamin E (-9 Kcal/mol) inmATPase cavity compares well with glibenclamide (-9.4 Kcal/mol) , while quercetinhad a binding energy of -7.1 Kcal/mol. Similarly , vitamin E , quercetin were boundto cytochrome c by -6.4 and - 5.5 Kcal/mol energy , while glibenclamide had -7.0Kcal/mol binding energy. The results showed that vitamin E was more accessible tothe protoporphyrin prosthetic group in cytochrome c than quercetin. In theexperimental studies , it was validated that vitamin E inhibited the uncontrolledactivity of mATPase in diabetic rat liver. This was also proven and tested on theliver mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening observed in diabeticrats. Further experimental assessment of these on activation of cytochrome cshowed that vitamin E reduced the extent of the activation more than quercetinand glibenclamide. CONCLUSION: There is a favorable protein-ligand interactionbetween quercetin and vitamin E in certain apoptotic proteins implicated indiabetes complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the nutritional status of serum fat-soluble vitamins suchas vitamin A , 25-hydroxyvitamin D , and vitamin E of minors in the Zhuzhou area toprovide a scientific basis for clinical guidance to supplement fat-solublevitamins reasonably. METHOD: A total of 6,082 minors who underwent physicalexamination from January 2017 to February 2019 in the Children's HealthDepartment of Zhuzhou Hospital affiliated with XiangYa School of Medicine ofCentral South University were selected as the subjects to measure the levels ofserum fat-soluble vitamins A , D , and E. RESULTS: (1) Their average levels ofserum vitamin A , 25-hydroxyvitamin D , and vitamin E were (0.34 ± 0.08) mg/mL ,(34.65 ± 10.24) ng/mL , and (10.11 ± 2.65) mg/mL , respectively. (2) Serum vitaminE showed a gender difference (P < 0.001). (3) The average levels of serum25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin E in infancy , early childhood , preschool age ,school age , and adolescence decreased gradually (P < 0.05). In contrast , theaverage level of serum vitamin A ranged between 0.32 mg/mL and 0.37 mg/mL. (4)The age was negatively correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r = -0.517 , P <0.001) and weakly negatively correlated with vitamin E (r = -0.366 , P < 0.001) ,but weakly positively correlated with vitamin A (r = 0.269 , P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Minors from infancy to adolescence in Zhuzhou should strengthen theirsupplementation of fat-soluble vitamins.

AB  - Vitamins are organic substances that are essential for the maintenance of lifeactivities. Generally , vitamins need to be obtained from the diet or from somesynthetic source as the body cannot synthesize vitamins , or the amounts of thesynthesized vitamins are insufficient. At present , vitamins are widely used inmedicine , food additives , feed additives , cosmetics and other fields , and theglobal demand for vitamins is constantly growing. Vitamins can be produced fromchemical or microbial synthesis. Chemical synthesis usually requires harshreaction conditions , produces serious wastes , and creates great potential safetyhazard. In contrast , microbial synthesis of vitamins is greener , safer , andrequires much less energy input. This review summarizes the advances in metabolicengineering for vitamins production in the past 30 years , with a focus onproduction of water-soluble vitamins (vitamins B1 , B2 , B3 , B5 , B6 , B7 , B9 , B12and vitamin C precursors) and lipid-soluble vitamins (vitamin A , precursors ofvitamin D , vitamin E and vitamin K). Moreover , the bottlenecks for fermentativeproduction of vitamins are discussed , and future perspectives for developing nextgeneration vitamins producing strains using synthetic biotechnology areprospected.

LID - 86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal jaundice indicates the presence of pigment in the skin andsclera. Vitamin E is an important component of the cellular antioxidant defensesystem. Here in the present study , we aimed to evaluate and investigate thesetherapeutic effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a randomized clinical trialperformed on 100 premature neonates. Group 1 received 10 units of Vitamin E dailyfor 5 days. The other group received placebo. Amount of bilirubin was measured atthe time of 0 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96 h after birth. RESULTS: Mean bilirubin inVitamin E group was increasing until the 2(nd) day and then got a decreasingtrend. In the control group , the increasing trend of bilirubin was going on tillthe 3(rd) day. Mean bilirubin increased significantly during the follow-up inboth Vitamin E and control groups (χ(2) [df] = 20.23 (1) , P < 0.001). Althoughboth groups showed an increasing trend in mean bilirubin , on the last day offollow-up , the average amount of increase was lower in Vitamin E group (5.06 ±2.25 vs. 6.23 ± 3.98). Also in the 3(rd) and 4(th) days , mean bilirubin was lowerin Vitamin E group. CONCLUSION: This study supports the usage of oral Vitamin Etherapies on reducing the bilirubin levels in neonates. We also showed that thisreduced trend occurs after day 3 of life , but in the follow-ups , neonates whowere treated with Vitamin E had lower bilirubin levels compared to the placebogroup.

TI  - Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Antioxidants as Immunomodulators in Exercise:Implications for Heme Oxygenase and Bilirubin.
LID - 10.3390/antiox11020179 [doi]
LID - 179
AB  - Exercise is commonly prescribed as a lifestyle treatment for chronic metabolicdiseases as it functions as an insulin sensitizer , cardio-protectant , andessential lifestyle tool for effective weight maintenance. Exercise boosts theproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent transient oxidativedamage , which also upregulates counterbalancing endogenous antioxidants toprotect from ROS-induced damage and inflammation. Exercise elevates hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) expression as built-inprotective mechanisms , which produce the most potent antioxidant , bilirubin.Together , these mitigate inflammation and adiposity. Moderately raising plasmabilirubin protects in two ways: (1) via its antioxidant capacity to reduce ROSand inflammation , and (2) its newly defined function as a hormone that activatesthe nuclear receptor transcription factor PPARα. It is now understood thatincreasing plasma bilirubin can also drive metabolic adaptions , which improvedeleterious outcomes of weight gain and obesity , such as inflammation , type IIdiabetes , and cardiovascular diseases. The main objective of this review is todescribe the function of bilirubin as an antioxidant and metabolic hormone andhow the HO-1-BVRA-bilirubin-PPARα axis influences inflammation , metabolicfunction and interacts with exercise to improve outcomes of weight management.

AB  - Self-assembling prodrugs represents a robust and effective nanotherapeuticapproach for delivering poorly soluble anticancer drugs. With numerous intrinsicadvantages , self-assembling prodrugs possess the maximum drug loading capacity ,controlled drug release kinetics , prolonged blood circulation , and preferentialtumor accumulation based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.These prodrug conjugates allow for efficient self-assembly into nanodrugs withthe potential of encapsulating other therapeutic agents that have differentmolecular targets , enabling simultaneous temporal-spatial release of drugs forsynergistic antitumor efficacy with reduced systemic side effects. The aim ofthis review is to summarize the recent progress of self-assembling prodrug cancernanotherapeutics that are made through conjugating therapeutically active agentsto Polyethylene glycol , Vitamin E , or drugs with different physicochemicalproperties via rational design , for synergistic tumor targeted drug delivery.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: All current FDA-approved nanomedicines use inertbiomaterials as drug delivery carriers. These biomaterials lack any therapeuticpotential , contributing not only to the cost , but may also elicit severeunfavorable adverse effects. Despite the reduction in toxicity associated withthe payload , these nanotherapeutics have been met with limited clinical success ,likely due to the monotherapy regimen. The self-assembling prodrug (SAP) has beenemerging as a powerful platform for enhancing efficacy through co-deliveringother therapeutic modalities with distinct molecular targets. Herein , weopportunely present a comprehensive review article summarizing three uniqueapproaches of making SAP for synergistic drug delivery: pegylation , vitaminE-derivatization , and drug-drug conjugation. These SAPs may inevitably pave theway for developing more efficacious , clinically translatable , combination cancernanotherapies.

LID - 10.3390/nu14173453 [doi]
LID - 3453
AB  - Objectives: Weight loss improves the liver pathophysiological status ofnonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. However , there are few studiesthat investigate the accurate relationships between nutritional intake anddisease progression in NAFLD patients. Methods: A total of 37 biopsy-confirmedNAFLD patients were enrolled in this study. Clinical and nutritional control dataof 5074 persons were obtained from the National Institute of Health andNutrition. Each NAFLD subject recorded dietary intake for seven consecutive daysusing a dietary questionnaire and photographs of each meal. A dietitian analyzedand quantified the nutritional data in each patient. We further analyzed thenutritional intake of NAFLD patients in three groups according to the followingcriteria: (1) liver fibrosis degree (advanced , early) , (2) gender (male , female) ,and (3) body mass index (BMI) (high , low). Results: Excesses or deficiencies ofmultiple nutrients were found in NAFLD patients compared with control subjects.In addition , there were variations in nutritional intake. (1) The intake ofvitamins A , B(6) , and E , pantothenic acid , soluble dietary fiber , and salt waslower in the advanced fibrosis group than in the early fibrosis group. (2) Fatintake was higher in male patients , and dietary fiber intake was lower in bothmale and female patients compared with control subjects. (3) Saturated fatty acidintake was higher , and copper and vitamin E intakes were lower in patients withhigh BMI than with low BMI. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that differenceswere found in some nutrient intake of NAFLD patients and controls and accordingto the severity of the conditions (liver fibrosis degree , BMI).

TI  - Increasing Cellular Uptake and Permeation of Curcumin Using a NovelPolymer-Surfactant Formulation.
LID - 10.3390/biom12121739 [doi]
LID - 1739
AB  - Several therapeutically active molecules are poorly water-soluble , therebycreating a challenge for pharmaceutical scientists to develop an active solutionfor their oral drug delivery. This study aimed to investigate the potential fornovel polymer-surfactant-based formulations (designated A and B) to improve thesolubility and permeability of curcumin. A solubility study and characterizationstudies (FTIR , DSC and XRD) were conducted for the various formulations. Thecytotoxicity of formulations and commercial comparators was tested via MTT andLDH assays , and their permeability by in vitro drug transport and cellular druguptake was established using the Caco-2 cell model. The apparent permeabilitycoefficients (Papp) are considered a good indicator of drug permeation. However ,it can be argued that the magnitude of Papp , when used to reflect thepermeability of the cells to the drug , can be influenced by the initial drugconcentration (C(0)) in the donor chamber. Therefore , Papp (suspension) and Papp(solution) were calculated based on the different values of C(0). It was clearthat Papp (solution) can more accurately reflect drug permeation than Papp(suspension). Formulation A , containing Soluplus(®) and vitamin E TPGs ,significantly increased the permeation and cellular uptake of curcumin comparedto other samples , which is believed to be related to the increased aqueoussolubility of the drug in this formulation.

AB  - A novel series of chalcone-Vitamin E-donepezil hybrids was designed and developedbased on multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) strategy for treating Alzheimer'sdisease (AD). The biological results revealed that compound 17f showed good AChEinhibitory potency (ratAChE IC(50) = 0.41 µM; eeAChE IC(50) = 1.88 µM). Both thekinetic analysis and docking study revealed that 17f was a mixed type AChEinhibitor. 17f was also a good antioxidant (ORAC = 3.3 eq) , selective metalchelator and huMAO-B inhibitor (IC(50) = 8.8 µM). Moreover , it showed remarkableinhibition of self- and Cu(2+)-induced Aβ(1-42) aggregation with a 78.0 and 93.5%percentage rate at 25 µM , respectively , and disassembled self-induced andCu(2+)-induced aggregation of the accumulated Aβ(1-42) fibrils with 72.3 and84.5% disaggregation rate , respectively. More importantly , 17f exhibited a goodneuroprotective effect on H(2)O(2)-induced PC12 cell injury and presented goodblood-brain barrier permeability in vitro. Thus , 17f was a promisingmulti-target-directed ligand for treating AD.

TI  - TPGS Decorated Liposomes as Multifunctional Nano-Delivery Systems.
PG  - 245-263
LID - 10.1007/s11095-022-03424-6 [doi]
AB  - Liposomes are sphere-shaped vesicles that can capture therapeutics either in theouter phospholipid bilayer or inner aqueous core. Liposomes , especially whensurface-modified with functional materials , have been used to achieve manybenefits in drug delivery , including improving drug solubility , oralbioavailability , pharmacokinetics , and delivery to disease target sites such ascancers. Among the functional materials used to modify the surface of liposomes ,the FDA-approved non-ionic surfactant D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycolsuccinate (TPGS) is increasingly being applied due to its biocompatibility , lackof toxicity , applicability to various administration routes and ability toenhance solubilization , stability , penetration and overall pharmacokinetics. TPGSdecorated liposomes are emerging as a promising drug delivery system for variousdiseases and are expected to enter the market in the coming years. In this reviewarticle , we focus on the multifunctional properties of TPGS-coated liposomes andtheir beneficial therapeutic applications , including for oral drug delivery ,vaccine delivery , ocular administration , and the treatment of various cancers. Wealso suggest future directions to optimise the manufacture and performance ofTPGS liposomes and , thus , the delivery and effect of encapsulated diagnostics andtherapeutics.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to evaluate the toxic effect of silvernanoparticles (Ag-NPs) on biochemical biomarkers , immune responses , and thecurative potential effects of vitamin C and E on grass carp. Fish (n = 420) withan average initial body weight of 8.045 ± 0.13 g were shifted to glass aquaria(36 x 18 x 18 inches , filled with 160-L tap water) in triplicates. Aquaria wererandomly designated as A , B , C , D with alone Ag-NPs (Control (0) , 0.25 , 0.50 ,0.75 mg/L) and E , F , G with Ag-NPs + Vit. C + Vit. E (0.25+0.25+0.25 ,0.50+0.50+0.50 , 0.75+0.75+0.75 mg/L). NPs particles were administrated viz , oraland intravenous routes for 7 days. The results indicated that both routes hadnon-significant effect , but levels of Ag-NPs had significant effect. TreatmentsC , D and G showed significant decrease in levels of RBC , HGB and HCT except forWBC and NEUT levels , which significantly increased. ALT , ALP , AST , urea , andcreatinine showed significant increase in activity in the C , D , and G groups.CAT , SOD decreased significantly in all Ag-NPs alone groups , while significantlyincreased with vitamin E and C. LYZ , TP , ALB , GLB showed significant low activityin the B , C , and D groups while significantly high activity in the E , F , and Ggroups. Cortisol , glucose and triglycerides showed significant increase in the B ,C , and D groups , while E , F , and G groups showed significant low levels oftriglycerides , COR , and GLU. Cholesterol level was same across all treatmentgroups. In conclusion , vitamin E and C as powerful antioxidants protect the fishagainst Ag-NPs except high dose level of 0.75mg/L , while 0.25mg/L of Ag-NPs waspresumably safe for C. idella.

AB  - Following the obesity epidemics , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) hasgrown in prevalence and become a main cause of morbidity and death , intimatelylinked to cardiovascular disease , cancer , and cirrhosis. The key factor in theevolution of NAFLD is thought to be oxidative stress. Because most patientscannot change their lifestyle or dietary habits , a pharmaceutical strategy is nowrequired to treat NAFLD. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) , includingnonalcoholic steatohepatitis , is treated with vitamin E. (NASH). Vitamin E isalso a powerful antioxidant that has been demonstrated to lower oxidative stressin people with NAFLD. Thymol is a monoterpene phenol with a variety ofpharmacological effects , however its anti-fatty liver properties have yet to beinvestigated. Despite the fact that oxidative stress is thought to have a role inthe etiology of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , antioxidant therapies have not beenwell studied in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The goal was tolearn more about vitamin E and thymol's biological activities , with a particularemphasis on their therapeutic effectiveness in NAFLD. Four groups of thirty-twoadult male rats were formed (healthy control , thymol , Vit E , and fatty liver).For 28 days , rats were given either oral vitamin E (200 mg/kg) or thymol (50mg/kg) randomly. The levels of ALT , AST , TNF- α , Ferritin , CK-MB enzymes , andMAPK gene expression were then determined in the serum. Based on a random effectmodel analysis , at the end of 28 days of therapy , ALT (41.43 U/L) , AST (47.91U/L) , Ferritin (1.13 pg/dl) , CK-MB (251.22 IU/L) , TNF-α (95.39 pg/mL) (p≤0.001) ,and MAPK gene expression levels (p≤0.05) significantly reduced in bothexperimental groups compared with the fatty liver group. Vitamin E and thymoltherapy is a safe , affordable , and effective therapeutic option in the fattyliver group. Patients with fatty liver disease should be encouraged to takevitamin E and Thymol supplements , which are both safe and affordable , becausemore effective new therapeutic options are lacking.

TI  - Water- and Fat-Soluble Antioxidants in Human Seminal Plasma and Serum of FertileMales.
LID - 10.3390/antiox8040096 [doi]
LID - 96
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are physiologically involved in functions likesperm maturation , capacitation and acrosome reaction , but their excess isinvolved in male infertility. Antioxidants in seminal plasma (SP) are animportant factor balancing physiologic and harmful ROS activities. In this study ,we determined and compared the full profiles of the water- and fat-solubleantioxidants in SP and serum of 15 healthy fertile subjects (ranging between theages of 35 and 42 years). Ejaculates were obtained after 2⁻5 days of sexualabstinence. After liquefaction and withdrawal of an aliquot for the sperm count ,samples were centrifuged to obtain SP. Thirty min after semen donation , a venousblood sample was collected from each subject. Donors with lower SP concentrationsof ascorbic acid (n = 5) or α-tocopherol (n = 5) received a 4 week oraladministration of either vitamin C (100 mg/day) or vitamin E (30 mg/day). Theywere then re-assayed to determine the SP and serum levels of ascorbic acid andα-tocopherol. SP and serum samples were properly processed and analyzed by HPLCmethods suitable to determine water (ascorbic acid , glutathione (GSH) and uricacid) and fat-soluble (all-trans-retinoic acid , all-trans-retinol , α-tocopherol ,carotenoids and coenzyme Q(10)) antioxidants. Data demonstrate that only ascorbicacid is higher in SP than in serum (SP/serum ratio = 4.97 ± 0.88). The otherwater-soluble antioxidants are equally distributed in the two fluids (GSHSP/serum ratio = 1.14 ± 0.34; uric acid SP/serum ratio = 0.82 ± 0.12). Allfat-soluble antioxidants are about 10 times less concentrated in SP than inserum. In donors treated with vitamin C or vitamin E , ascorbic acid andα-tocopherol significantly increased in both fluids. However , the SP/serum ratioof ascorbic acid was 4.15 ± 0.45 before and 3.27 ± 0.39 after treatment , whilstthose of α-tocopherol were 0.11 ± 0.03 before and 0.10 ± 0.02 after treatment.The results of this study , by showing the peculiar composition in water- andfat-soluble antioxidants SP , indicate that it is likely that still-unknownmechanisms allow ascorbic acid accumulation in SP against a concentrationgradient. SP mainly relies its defenses on water- rather than fat-solubleantioxidants and on the mechanisms ensuring their transfer from serum.

LID - 10.3390/ijms24054425 [doi]
LID - 4425
AB  - α-tocopherol is the physiologically most active form of vitamin E , with numerousbiological activities , such as significant antioxidant activity , anticancercapabilities , and anti-aging properties. However , its low water solubility haslimited its potential use in the food , cosmetic , and pharmaceutical industries.One possible strategy for addressing this issue is the use of a supramolecularcomplex with large-ring cyclodextrins (LR-CDs). In this study , the phasesolubility of the CD26/α-tocopherol complex was investigated to assess thepossible ratios between host and guest in the solution phase. Next , thehost-guest association of the CD26/α-tocopherol complex at different ratios of1:2 , 1:4 , 1:6 , 2:1 , 4:1 , and 6:1 was studied by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)simulations. At 1:2 ratio , two α-tocopherol units interact spontaneously withCD26 , forming an inclusion complex , as supported by the experimental data. In the2:1 ratio , a single α-tocopherol unit was encapsulated by two CD26 molecules. Incomparison , increasing the number of α-tocopherol or CD26 molecules above two ledto self-aggregation and consequently limited the solubility of α-tocopherol. Thecomputational and experimental results indicate that a 1:2 ratio could be themost suitable stoichiometry to use in the CD26/α-tocopherol complex to improveα-tocopherol solubility and stability in inclusion complex formation.

AB  - Equine neuroaxonal dystrophy/equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM)is an inherited neurodegenerative disease associated with vitamin E deficiency inthe first year of life. It is the second most common cause of spinal ataxia inhorses euthanized for neurologic disease. Equine NAD/EDM is characterized byneurologic signs including a symmetric proprioceptive ataxia (> grade 2/5) and awide-base stance at rest. There are currently no antemortem tests for eNAD/EDM inany breed. Conclusive diagnosis requires postmortem histologic evaluation of thebrainstem and spinal cord at necropsy. Research studies on antemortem biomarkersand genetic testing are ongoing. The development of a genetic test for eNAD/EDMwould have widespread impact , even if it were breed specific. Currently , the bestapproach to eNAD/EDM is to focus on preventing cases by providing pregnant maresand foals with access to pasture. Alternatively , dams' diets can be supplementedwith high doses of water-soluble RRR-α-tocopherol during the last trimester ofgestation , with continued supplementation of foals through the first two years oflife. It is important to measure horses' baseline serum vitamin E levels prior tosupplementing. While considered generally safe , oversupplementation of vitamin Eis possible and can lead to coagulopathies.

TI  - Anticancer properties of tocotrienols: A review of cellular mechanisms andmolecular targets.

LID - 10.1002/jcp.27075 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E is composed of two groups of compounds: α- , β- , γ- , and δ-tocopherols(TPs) , and the corresponding unsaturated tocotrienols (TTs). TTs are found innatural sources such as red palm oil , annatto seeds , and rice bran. In the lastdecades , TTs (specifically , γ-TT and δ-TT) have gained interest due to theirhealth benefits in chronic diseases , based on their antioxidant , neuroprotective ,cholesterol-lowering , anti-inflammatory activities. Several in vitro and in vivostudies pointed out that TTs also exert a significant antitumor activity in awide range of cancer cells. Specifically , TTs were shown to exertantiproliferative/proapoptotic effects and to reduce the metastatic or angiogenicproperties of different cancer cells; moreover , these compounds were reported tospecifically target the subpopulation of cancer stem cells , known to be deeplyinvolved in the development of resistance to standard therapies. Interestingly ,recent studies pointed out that TTs exert a synergistic antitumor effect oncancer cells when given in combination with either standard antitumor agents(i.e. , chemotherapeutics , statins , "targeted" therapies) or natural compoundswith anticancer activity (i.e. , sesamin , epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) ,resveratrol , ferulic acid). Based on these observations , different TT syntheticderivatives and formulations were recently developed and demonstrated to improveTT water solubility and to reduce TT metabolism in cancer cells , thus increasingtheir biological activity. These promising results , together with the safety ofTT administration in healthy subjects , suggest that these compounds mightrepresent a new chemopreventive or anticancer treatment (i.e. , in combinationwith standard therapies) strategy. Clinical trials aimed at confirming thisantitumor activity of TTs are needed.

AB  - Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity , neuroinflammation , and oxidative stress arecommon underlying events in neurodegeneration. This pathogenic "triad"characterizes the neurobiology of epilepsy , leading to seizure-induced celldeath , increased susceptibility to neuronal synchronization and networkalterations. Along with other maladaptive changes , these events pave the way tospontaneous recurrent seizures and progressive degeneration of the interestedbrain areas. In vivo models of epilepsy are available to explore suchepileptogenic mechanisms , also assessing the efficacy of chemoprevention andtherapy strategies at the pre-clinical level. The kainic acid model ofpharmacological excitotoxicity and epileptogenesis is one of the mostinvestigated mimicking the chronicization profile of temporal lobe epilepsy inhumans. Its pathogenic cues include inflammatory and neuronal death pathwayactivation , mitochondrial disturbances and lipid peroxidation of several regionsof the brain , the most vulnerable being the hippocampus. The importance ofneuroinflammation and lipid peroxidation as underlying molecular events of braindamage was demonstrated in this model by the possibility to counteract therelated maladaptive morphological and functional changes of this organ withvitamin E , the main fat-soluble cellular antioxidant and "conditional" co-factorof enzymatic pathways involved in polyunsaturated lipid metabolism andinflammatory signaling. The present review paper provides an overview of theliterature supporting the potential for a timely intervention with vitamin Etherapy in clinical management of seizures and epileptogenic processes associatedwith excitotoxicity , neuroinflammation and lipid peroxidation , i.e. thepathogenic "triad".

AB  - BACKGROUNDWe hypothesized that obesity-associated hepatosteatosis is apathophysiological chemical depot for fat-soluble vitamins and altered normalphysiology. Using α-tocopherol (vitamin E) as a model vitamin , pharmacokineticsand kinetics principles were used to determine whether excess liver fatsequestered α-tocopherol in women with obesity-associated hepatosteatosis versushealthy controls.METHODSCustom-synthesized deuterated α-tocopherols (d3- andd6-α-tocopherols) were administered to hospitalized healthy women and women withhepatosteatosis under investigational new drug guidelines. Fluorescently labeledα-tocopherol was custom-synthesized for cell studies.RESULTSIn healthy subjects ,85% of intravenous d6-α-tocopherol disappeared from the circulation within 20minutes but reappeared within minutes and peaked at 3-4 hours; d3- andd6-α-tocopherols localized to lipoproteins. Lipoprotein redistribution occurredonly in vivo within 1 hour , indicating a key role of the liver in uptake andre-release. Compared with healthy subjects who received 2 mg , subjects withhepatosteatosis had similar d6-α-tocopherol entry rates into liver but reducedinitial release rates (P < 0.001). Similarly , pharmacokinetics parameters werereduced in hepatosteatosis subjects , indicating reduced hepatic d6-α-tocopheroloutput. Reductions in kinetics and pharmacokinetics parameters in hepatosteatosissubjects who received 2 mg were echoed by similar reductions in healthy subjectswhen comparing 5- and 2-mg doses. In vitro , fluorescent-labeled α-tocopherollocalized to lipid in fat-loaded hepatocytes , indicatingsequestration.CONCLUSIONSThe unique role of the liver in vitamin E physiology isdysregulated by excess liver fat. Obesity-associated hepatosteatosis may produceunrecognized hepatic vitamin E sequestration , which might subsequently driveliver disease. Our findings raise the possibility that hepatosteatosis maysimilarly alter hepatic physiology of other fat-soluble vitamins.TRIALREGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00862433.FUNDINGNational Institute of Diabetesand Digestive and Kidney Diseases and NIH grants DK053213-13 , DK067494 , andDK081761.

AB  - Grape berries have been extensively studied in terms of antioxidantcharacterization , specifically in anthocyanin , total phenol , and tanninaccumulation. However , very little is known about vitamin E composition andcontents in this fruit. Aiming to examine the function of vitamin E during grapeberries ripening , tocochromanol contents and composition were evaluated inberries and leaves of grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Merlot) , from just beforeveraison to commercial harvest. We also determined the time-course evolution oftocochromanol accumulation in various fruit tissues , including the skin , pulp ,and seeds , and measured the extent of primary and secondary lipid peroxidation ,as well as fruit technological maturity parameters. Vitamin E accumulated athigher levels in leaves than in fruits , although the tissue-specific evaluationof tocochromanol contents revealed that berry skin is also rich in α-tocopherolwhereas tocotrienols were present in seeds only. α-Tocopherol content decreasedduring ripening , more specifically in the skin , and it was accompanied by anincrease in the extent of lipid peroxidation. Contents and variations in thelevels of α-tocopherol , but not those of the other tocochromanols , were inverselyrelated to changes in lipid peroxidation during fruit ripening , as indicated bytissue-specific variations in malondialdehyde contents. In conclusion ,α-tocopherol is more abundant in leaves than fruit , yet it apears to exert a rolein the modulation of the extent of lipid peroxidation in grape berries , morespecifically in the skin , where α-tocopherol depletion and malondialdehydeaccumulation may be related to an adequate progression of fruit ripening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary micronutrients may play important roles in the improvement ofthe immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to assess the effect ofmicronutrients on platelet activating factor (PAF) and immunity with a specialfocus on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: All paper published inEnglish on the effects of micronutrients including fat soluble vitamins , watersoluble vitamins , and minerals on PAF , immunity , and COVID-19 were collected fromonline valid databases. RESULTS: Vitamin A may modulate the expression ofPAF-receptor gene in patients with COVID-19. Vitamin D may modulate inflammatoryresponse through influencing PAF pathway. Vitamin E may improve COVID-19 relatedheart injuries by exert anti-PAF activities. Vitamin C status may have PAFrelated anti-inflammatory and micro-thrombotic effects in SARS-CoV-2 patients.Furthermore , some trace elements such as copper , selenium , and iron may have keyroles in strengthens immunity by inactivate PAF acetyl hydrolase. CONCLUSION:This narrative review study highlighted the importance of micronutrients in theimprovement of immune function through modulation of PAF in patients withCOVID-19. Further longitudinal studies are warranted.

TI  - Self-Assembled Nanomicellar Formulation of Docetaxel as a Potential Breast CancerChemotherapeutic System.
LID - 10.3390/life12040485 [doi]
LID - 485
AB  - Docetaxel (DTX) is classified as a class IV drug that exhibits poor aqueoussolubility (6-7 µg/mL in water) and permeability (P-glycoprotein substrate). Themain objective of this study was to construct , characterize , and evaluatedocetaxel loaded nanomicellar formulation in vitro for oral delivery to enhancethe absorption and bioavailability of DTX , as well as to circumvent P-gp effluxinhibition. Formulations were prepared with two polymeric surfactants ,hydrogenated castor oil-40 (HCO-40) and D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000succinate (VIT E TPGS) with solvent evaporation technique , and the resulting DTXnanomicellar formulations were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonancespectroscopy (1H NMR) , Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) , X-raypowder diffraction (XRD) , and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Proton NMR ,FT-IR , and XRD data indicated that DTX was completely encapsulated within thehydrophobic core of the nanomicelles in its amorphous state. TEM data revealed asmooth spherical shape of the nanomicellar formulation. The optimized formulation(F-2) possessed a mean diameter of 13.42 nm , a zeta potential of -0.19 mV , with a99.3% entrapment efficiency. Dilution stability study indicated that nanomicelleswere stable up to 100-fold dilution with minimal change in size , poly dispersityindex (PDI) , and zeta potential. In vitro cytotoxicity study revealed higheranticancer activity of DTX nanomicelles at 5 µM compared to the native drugagainst breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) cells. The LC-MS data confirmed thechemical stability of DTX within the nanomicelles. In vitro drug release studydemonstrated faster dissolution of DTX from the nanomicelles compared to thenaked drug. Our experimental results exhibit that nanomicelles could be a drugdelivery system of choice to encapsulate drugs with low aqueous solubility andpermeability that can preserve the stability of the active constituents toprovide anticancer activity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bone mineral density (BMD) in adolescence is a crucial determinantin osteoporosis and fragility fractures in older age. Vitamin E is the mostabundant lipid-soluble antioxidant present in the blood. However , the associationof vitamin E status with BMD in children and adolescents remains unclear.METHODS: We first measured the association of vitamin E status (serum α- and γtocopherol) with BMD in children and adolescents with the National Health andNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multiple linear regression models wereperformed to evaluate their relationship after adjusting for a large range ofcovariates. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were used to explore theireffects on different genders , ages , and races/ethnicities. RESULTS: 13,606children and adolescents from NHANES (2005-2006 , 2017-2018) were included in ouranalysis. Compared with the lowest α-tocopherol quartile , individuals in thehighest α-tocopherol quartile are likelier to be Non-Hispanic White and have ahigher value of poverty income ratio (PIR). They have a lower value of serumphosphorus and lumbar spine BMD. Every 1umol/L increase in serum α- and γ-tocopherol , the lumbar spine BMD decreased by -0.0016 and -0.0068 g/cm2. Comparedwith the lowest quartile serum α- and γ- tocopherol concentration , individuals inthe highest quartile have a -0.0223 and -0.0329 g/cm2 lower mean BMD ,respectively. Interaction effects suggest that the negative effect is moreprominent among female youth , individuals aged 8-13 years , non-Hispanic whites ,Mexican Americans , and non-Hispanic blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicatesserum α- and γ-tocopherol are negatively correlated with lumbar BMD. Age , gender ,and race may have a modifying effect on this relationship. Our study has animportant clinical implication. A higher vitamin E status for children andadolescents could not improve BMD , even decrease BMD. More prospective researchwith stronger evidence is needed to verify our findings and their underlyingmechanisms.

AB  - The oral bioavailability and efficacy of baicalein is dramatically limited by itslow solubility and effect of efflux. In our study , we chose PVP-VA64 as a carrierand TPGS as a plasticizer and efflux inhibitor to prepare a solid dispersion ofbaicalein using hot-melt extrusion technology to improve its solubility andbioavailability. The hot-melt process and formulation were optimized , and aBAC-PVP VA64-TPGS solid dispersion (BPT-SD) was prepared. BAC exists in anamorphous or molecular state in BPT-SD. BPT-SD comprised irregular lumps andsmall particles without BAC or carrier characteristics. The dissolutionefficiency of BPT-SD improved under sink conditions. FTIR showed a stronghydrogen bond between BAC and PVP-VA64 in BPT-SD. BPT-SD maintained good physicalstability for 6 months. The apparent permeability coefficient of BAC in theCaco-2 cell model confirmed that BPT-SD had higher gastrointestinal membranepermeability. A rat pharmacokinetic study showed that BPT-SD had higher C(max)and AUC(0-)24h , shorter T(max) , and 2.88-fold higher bioavailability than BAC. Abehavioral experiment in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice confirmedthe antidepressant efficacy of BAC. BPT-SD reversed depression-like behavior inCUMS mice and improved BAC bioavailability. BAC preparation into a soliddispersion significantly enhanced dissolution performance and bioavailability.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) , are characterizedby massive loss of specific neurons. It is a progressive disabling , severe andfatal complex disease. Due to its complex pathogenesis and limitations ofclinical treatment strategies , it poses a serious medical challenge and medicalburden worldwide. The pathogenesis of AD is not clear , and its potentialbiological mechanisms include aggregation of soluble amyloid to form insolubleamyloid plaques , abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and formation ofintracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) , neuroinflammation , ferroptosis ,oxidative stress and metal ion disorders. Among them , ferroptosis is a newlydiscovered programmed cell death induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation andreactive oxygen species. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is closelyrelated to AD , but the mechanism remains unclear. It may be induced by ironmetabolism , amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism affecting the accumulationof iron ions. Some iron chelating agents (deferoxamine , deferiprone) ,chloroiodohydroxyquine and its derivatives , antioxidants (vitamin E , lipoic acid ,selenium) , chloroiodohydroxyquine and its derivatives Fer-1 , tet , etc. have beenshown in animal studies to be effective in AD and exert neuroprotective effects.This review summarizes the mechanism of ferroptosis in AD and the regulation ofnatural plant products on ferroptosis in AD , in order to provide referenceinformation for future research on the development of ferroptosis inhibitors.

AB  - Iron is an essential nutrient that forms cofactors required for the activity ofhundreds of cellular proteins. However , iron can be toxic and must be preciselymanaged. Poly r(C) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is an essential , multifunctionalprotein that binds both iron and nucleic acids , regulating the fate of both. Asan iron chaperone , PCBP1 binds cytosolic iron and delivers it to iron enzymes foractivation and to ferritin for storage. Mice deleted for PCBP1 in the liverexhibit dysregulated iron balance , with lower levels of liver iron stores andiron enzymes , but higher levels of chemically-reactive iron. Unchaperoned irontriggers the formation of reactive oxygen species , leading to lipid peroxidationand ferroptotic cell death. Hepatic PCBP1 deletion produces chronic liver diseasein mice , with steatosis , triglyceride accumulation , and elevated plasma ALTlevels. Human and mouse models of fatty liver disease are associated withmitochondrial dysfunction. Here we show that , although deletion of PCBP1 does notaffect mitochondrial iron balance , it does affect mitochondrial function. PCBP1deletion affected mitochondrial morphology and reduced levels of respiratorycomplexes II and IV , oxygen consumption , and ATP production. Depletion ofmitochondrial lipids cardiolipin and coenzyme Q , along with reduction ofmitochondrial oxygen consumption , were the first manifestations of mitochondrialdysfunction. Although dietary supplementation with vitamin E ameliorated theliver disease in mice with hepatic PCBP1 deletion , supplementation with coenzymeQ was required to fully restore mitochondrial lipids and function. In conclusion ,our studies indicate that mitochondrial function can be restored in liverssubjected to ongoing oxidative damage from unchaperoned iron by supplementationwith coenzyme Q , a mitochondrial lipid essential for respiration that alsofunctions as a lipophilic radical-trapping agent.

AB  - Nowadays , nanomaterials enter high numbers of daily used products and drugmanufacture. A nanocomposite of vitamins C (VC) and vitamin E (VE) with chitosanas a vehicle and protector was used in a comparative eight-week feeding study ,Nile tilapia weighing 31.2 ± 0.36 g distributed in seven groups and fed (G1)basal diet , (G2) bulk VC , (G3) VC- nanoparticles (NPs) , (G4) bulk VE , (G5)VE-NPs , bulk VCE (G6) , and (G7) VC plus VE (VCE)-NPs , respectively. The Niletilapia-fed nanocomposite vitamins had significantly higher growth performancecompared to the control; VCE-NPs had the superiority among testedsupplementations where total weight gain (63.6 g) , daily weight gain (1.13 g) ,relative growth rate (206.1%) with lower feed conversion rate (1.6) andinsignificant feed intake (101.5 g). Overall , the level of liver enzymes wassignificantly decreased in fish serum after eight-week nanocompositesupplementation , and dietary VCE-NPs caused a significant reduction of serum AST(18.45 IU/L) and ALT (14.77 IU/L) compared to the control 25.5 IU/L and17.6 IU/L , respectively. Fish fed dietary VCE-NPs , VC-NPs , and VE-NPs hadsignificant enhancement of RBCs 4.2 × 10(6)/μL , 3.8 × 10(6)/μL , and3.55 × 10(6)/μL; WBCs 46.15 × 10(3) , 42.9 × 10(3) , and 44 × 10(3)/μL ,respectively , Also TP was significantly higher 6.38 g/dL in VCE-NPs groupcompared to the control and the other treatments. Over all , the dietarynanocomposite vitamins boost the innate immunity of the experimental Niletilapia , the oxidative burst activity (OBA) , phagocytic activity (PA) , phagocyticindex (PI) , and serum antibacterial (SAA) were significantly increased comparedto those received bulk vitamins and the control. The activity of antioxidantbiomarkers in fish serum including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) ,superoxide dismutase (SOD) , total antioxidant capacity (TAC) , glutathionereductase (GR), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) showed a rise in the serum of Niletilapia received nano- and bulk-form of VC and VCE compared to the control andboth forms of VE. Furthermore , the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) , reducedglutathione (GSH) , and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were significantly increasedin the fish serum following the trend of antioxidants enzymes. In conclusion , adietary nanocomposite of vitamin C and vitamin E enhanced Nile tilapia's growthperformance and feed utilization. It could also improve health status and immuneresponse. The values of antioxidant biomarkers indicated that the nanocompositecould help the fish body scavenge the generated reactive oxidative species (ROS).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Short bowel syndrome (SBS) results from significant intestinal lossand is characterized by insufficient absorption of nutrients and fluids.Preclinical large animal SBS models typically require parenteral nutrition (PN)support and may not be appropriate for studying interventions to improveintestinal absorption or adaptation. Here , we describe the development of aporcine SBS model that does not require PN support. METHODS: Eight male Yorkshirepiglets underwent either a 75% or 90% jejunoileal resection (n = 5) or noresection (n = 3). Continuous enteral nutrition (EN) was provided via agastrostomy tube. The final SBS model consisted of a 75% resection and nutritionprovided via combination EN (60%) and per oral pig chow (40%). Body weight andconcentration of fat-soluble vitamins were assessed on postoperative days (POD)7 , 14 , and 21. For assessing fat malabsorption , the coefficient of fat absorption(CFA) was calculated following a 72-h stool collection. RESULTS: Resected animalshad decreased weight gain compared to unresected controls (POD21 + 8.3% versus+28.8% , P = 0.048). Vitamin D concentration was significantly lower in resectedanimals compared to controls on POD 7 , POD 14 , and POD 21. Serum vitamin Econcentration was also lower on POD 21. Resected animals developed fatmalabsorption with lower CFA (76.5% versus 95.3% , P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Wedescribe the development of a porcine SBS model that does not require PN support.Piglets in this model gain less weight , demonstrate fat malabsorption , anddevelop fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. This model will benefit investigationsof intestinal absorption or adaptation while potentially decreasing costs andconfounding complications related to PN administration.

TI  - Association of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Therapy and Vitamin E Supplementationwith Vitamin K Deficiency-Induced Coagulopathy: A Case Report and NarrativeReview of the Literature.
LID - 10.3390/jpm13091349 [doi]
LID - 1349
AB  - Vitamin K is a lipid-soluble vitamin that is normally maintained withinappropriate levels by means of dietary intake and bacterial production in theintestinal microflora. It holds a central role in coagulation homeostasis , andthus its depletion leads to hypocoagulation and haemorrhagic diathesis. Theassociation of antibiotic therapy and vitamin E supplementation with vitamin Kdeficiency was previously described in animal experiments , clinical studies , andcase reports. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy potentially leads to intestinalmicroflora dysbiosis and restriction of vitamin K-producing bacterialpopulations , resulting in decreased vitamin K levels , whereas antibiotics of thecephalosporin class with 1-N-methyl-5-thiotetrazole (NMTT) or2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole (MTD) side groups inhibit vitamin K function. VitaminE supplementation interferes with both the bioavailability and function ofvitamin K , yet its mechanisms are not fully understood. We present the case of a45-year-old male patient , with a history of epilepsy and schizophrenia ,catatonically incapacitated and immobilised , who was hospitalised in our centrefor the investigation and management of aspiration pneumonia. He demonstrated aprogressively worsening prolongation of international normalised ratio (INR) ,which was attributed to both broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and vitamin Esupplementation and was reversed upon administration of vitamin K. We highlightthe need for close monitoring of coagulation parameters in patients receivingbroad-spectrum antibiotic therapy , especially those with underlying malnutritiveor malabsorptive conditions , and we further recommend the avoidance of NMTT- orMTD-containing antibiotics or vitamin E supplementation , unless absolutelynecessary , in those patients.

PG  - e9018
LID - 10.7759/cureus.9018 [doi]
LID - e9018
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes ofchronic liver disease. It is characterized by a variety of pathologies , rangingfrom benign fatty liver to extensive fibrosis and even hepatocellular cancer.Among the several potential risk factors , insulin resistance and increasedoxidative stress are the most important. Vitamin E is an antioxidant with apotential to be used as a treatment for NAFLD. Therefore , we carried out astructured systematic review of all RCTs conducted between 2010 and January 2020.After screening , eight RCTs were included. Our systematic review showed thatvitamin E has clinical utility in improving biochemical (ALT and AST levels) andhistological abnormalities in NAFLD (hepatic steatosis and lobular inflammation).However , vitamin E does not seem to have significant effects on liver fibrosis.Still , vitamin E has the potential to be used as an adjuvant for the treatment ofNAFLD , and its use in clinical practice should be advocated.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been considered the main contributor to liver injury.Dietary antioxidants would be expected to improve liver function. Thehepatoprotective effects of antioxidants are controversial. In the present study ,the associations of some dietary antioxidants and the levels of serum liverenzymes were examined. This cross-sectional study was conducted using theRafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS) data as a population-based prospective cohort whichis a part of the Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN).A total of 9942 participants aged 35-70 years old were included in this study.Among this population , 4631 (46.59%) were male , and 5311 (53.42%) were female.Dietary intakes were collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)with 128 items. Aspartate transaminase (AST) , Alanine transaminase (ALT) ,γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) , and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured by abiotecnica analyzer. Dichotomous logistics regression models were used toinvestigate the association between the elevated liver enzymes and intake ofdietary antioxidants using crude and adjusted models. In the adjusted model , insubjects with higher consumption of Se , Vit A , Vit E , β-carotene , α-carotene , andβ-cryptoxanthin , the odds ratios of elevated ALP were decreased compared to thereference group (ORs 0.79 (0.64-0.96) , 0.80 (0.66-0.98) , 0.73 (0.60-0.89) , 0.79(0.64-0.96) , 0.78 (0.64-0.95) , 0.80 (0.66-0.98) , and 0.79 (0.64-0.98) ,respectively). Subjects with higher consumption of Se , Vit A , Vit E , andprovitamin A carotenoids (β-carotene , α-carotene , β-cryptoxanthin) showeddecreased odds of elevated ALP. These findings support the hypothesis that Se ,Vit A , Vit E , and provitamin A carotenoids may be associated with improvements inALP and act as suppressors against the development of liver injury.

AB  - Based on single-center data , the related predictive factors of preeclampsia (PE)were investigated , and a nomogram prediction model was established and validated.A retrospective collection of 93 PE patients admitted to our hospital fromJanuary 2019 to January 2021 were included in the PE group. In addition , non-PEpregnant women were selected for physical examination during the same period formatching , and 170 normal pregnant women who met the matching conditions werefound as the normal pregnancy group. Clinical data of the selected candidateswere collected. The risk factors of PE were screened by logistic regressionanalysis , and the lipopograph prediction model was constructed and verified.Logistic analysis results showed that age (OR = 3.069 , 95% CI = 1.233-7.638) ,prepregnancy BMI (OR = 2.896 , 95% CI = 1.193-7.029) , vitamin E deficiency(OR = 2.803 , 95% CI = 1.134-6.928) , 25-(OH)D (OR = 0.944 , 95% CI = 0.903∼9.988) ,PLGF (OR = 0.887 , 95% CI = 0.851∼0.924) , PAPP-A (OR = 1.240 , 95%CI = 1.131∼1.360) , and PI (OR = 6.376 , 95% CI = 1.163∼34.967) were theindependent risk factors for PE prediction (P < 0.05). The ROC curve showed thatthe AUC of the model for predicting the risk of PE was 0.957 (95% CI:0.935-0.979) , and the specificity and sensitivity were 0.912 and 0.892 ,respectively. H-L goodness of the fit test showed that there was no statisticalsignificance in the deviation between the actual observed value and the predictedvalue of the risk in the line graph model (χ (2) = 7.001 , P=0.536). The bootstraptest was used for internal verification , and the original data were repeatedlysampled 1000 times. The average absolute error of the calibration curve is 0.014 ,and the fitting degree between the calibration curve and the ideal curve is good.Age , prepregnancy BMI , lack of vitamin E , 25-(OH)D , PLGF , PAPP-A , and PI areindependent risk factors for predicting PE. The establishment of a nomogramprediction model based on the above parameters can help identify PE high-riskgroups in the early clinical stage and provide a reference for individualizedclinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Particulate oxidative potential may comprise a key health-relevant parameter ofparticulate matter (PM) toxicity. To identify biological perturbations associatedwith particulate oxidative potential and examine the underlying molecularmechanisms , we recruited 54 participants from two dormitories near and far from acongested highway in Atlanta , GA. Fine particulate matter oxidative potential("FPMOP") levels at the dormitories were measured using dithiothreitol assay.Plasma and saliva samples were collected from participants four times forlongitudinal high-resolution metabolic profiling. We conducted metabolome-wideassociation studies to identify metabolic signals with FPMOP. Leukotrienemetabolism and galactose metabolism were top pathways associated with ≥5FPMOP-related indicators in plasma , while vitamin E metabolism and leukotrienemetabolism were found associated with most FPMOP indicators in saliva. Weobserved different patterns of perturbed pathways significantly associated withwater-soluble and -insoluble FPMOPs , respectively. We confirmed five metabolitesdirectly associated with FPMOP , including hypoxanthine , histidine , pyruvate ,lactate/glyceraldehyde , and azelaic acid , which were implications ofperturbations in acute inflammation , nucleic acid damage and repair , and energyperturbation. The unique metabolic signals were specific to FPMOP , but not PMmass , providing initial indication that FPMOP might constitute a more sensitive ,health-relevant measure for elucidating etiologies related to PM(2.5) exposures.

TI  - The Impact of Vitamin Deficiencies on Oral Manifestations in Children.
LID - 10.3390/dj12040109 [doi]
LID - 109
AB  - Vitamins play a vital role in human health , particularly in the development andmaintenance of oral health in children. These nutrients are broadly categorizedinto fat-soluble and water-soluble types , crucial for children's well-being. Theobjective of this study is to investigate the impact of vitamin deficiencies onthe oral health of children , focusing on how these deficiencies contribute tovarious oral health issues and determining the relationship between specificvitamin shortages and oral diseases. Findings indicate that shortages in vitaminsA and D lead to enamel issues and a higher susceptibility to dental diseases ,vitamin E assists in treating oral mucositis , and vitamin K is essential forblood clotting in dental surgeries. Deficits in B-complex and vitamin C result inenamel hypomineralization and soft tissue ailments , including aphthous stomatitisand gingival petechiae. Additionally , a lack of vitamin B7 compromises the immuneresponse , increasing oral candidiasis risk. Therefore , vitamin deficienciesmarkedly affect children's oral health , highlighting the need for joint effortsbetween dental professionals and caregivers for effective pediatric care.Addressing vitamin deficiencies through supplementation and tailored dental careemphasizes the significance of nutritional health in children's overall anddental well-being , advocating for a collaborative approach to achieve optimalhealth outcomes.

TI  - Safety and Tolerability of PCSK9 Inhibitors: Current Insights.
PG  - 191-202
LID - 10.2147/CPAA.S288831 [doi]
AB  - The current era of preventive cardiology continues to emphasize on low-densitylipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction to alleviate the burden ofatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In this regard , thepharmacological inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9(PCSK9) enzyme via monoclonal antibodies has emerged as a novel lipid-loweringtherapy , leading to a marked reduction in circulating LDL-C levels and subsequentimprovement of cardiovascular outcomes. As these agents are increasingly used incurrent clinical practice , mounting scientific and clinical evidence supportsthat PCSK9 inhibitors offer an excellent safety and tolerability profile with alow incidence of adverse events. Notably , the most frequently reported sideeffects are injection-site reactions. In contrast to statins , PCSK9 inhibitors donot appear to exert a detrimental effect on glycemic control or to increase theincidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Accumulating evidence also indicatesthat PCSK9 inhibitors are a safe , well-tolerated and effective therapeuticstrategy for patients with statin intolerance. On the other hand , as PCSK9inhibitors reduce LDL-C to unprecedented low levels , a large body of currentresearch has examined the effects of their long-term administration onneurocognition and on levels of vitamin E and other fat-soluble vitamins ,providing encouraging results. This review aims to present and discuss thecurrent clinical and scientific evidence pertaining to the safety andtolerability of PCSK9 inhibitors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mercury is one of the most harmful heavy metals and itstoxicity causes severe multi-organ dysfunction. This study was designed toexplore novel molecular pathways involved in the hepatoprotective effect ofvitamin E (Vit-E) and Lactobacillius plantarum (Lac-B) against mercury toxicity.METHOD: Acute hepatotoxicity was induced by administration of high dose ofmercuric chloride (HgCl(2)) in male rats , Vit-E or/and Lac-B were given alongwith HgCl(2) for 2 weeks. The effects of those antioxidants were studied focusingon their anti-apoptotic , anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory eficacies.Histopathological examinations were also conducted. RESULTS: The administrationof HgCl(2) induced liver injury which manifested by elevation in serum ALT andAST. Liver MDA , caspase-3 and TNF-α levels were markedly increased; whereas , GSHlevel and SOD activity were declined. HgCl(2) significantly elevated theexpressions of hepatic CHOP , GPR87 , NF-κB and mTOR. Histopathological examinationrevealed massive hepatocyte degeneration following HgCl(2) administration.Treatment with Vit-E or/and Lac-B restored the normal levels of the previouslymentioned parameters , as well as improved hepatic architecture. CONCLUSION: Vit-Eand Lac-B provided protective effect against HgCl(2)-induced hepatotoxicity viareduction of oxidative stress and inflammation , and downregulation of CHOP ,GPR87 , NF-κB and mTOR proteins' expressions.

AB  - Multifunctional drug delivery carriers have emerged as a promising cancer drugdelivery strategy. Here , we developed a vitamin E succinate-chitosan-histidine(VCH) multi-program responsive drug carrier. The structure was characterized byFT-IR and (1)H NMR spectrum , and the DLS and SEM results showed typicalnanostructures. The drug loading content was 21.0 % and the correspondingencapsulation efficiency was 66.6 %. The UV-vis and fluorescence spectrademonstrated the existence of the π-π stacking interaction between DOX and VCH.Drug release experiments implied good pH sensitivity and sustained-releaseeffect. The DOX/VCH nanoparticles could be efficiently taken up by HepG2 cancercells and the tumor inhibition rate was up to 56.27 %. The DOX/VCH reduced thetumor volume and weight efficiently with a TIR of 45.81 %. The histologicalanalysis results showed that DOX/VCH could effectively inhibit tumor growth andproliferation , and there was no damage to normal organs. VCH nanocarriers couldcombine the advantages of VES , histidine and chitosan to achieve pH sensitivityand P-gp inhibition , and effectively improve the drug solubility , targeting andlysosomal escape. Through the program response of different micro-environment ,the newly developed polymeric micelles could successfully be utilized as amulti-program responsive nanocarrier system for the treatment of cancers.

AB  - Nanocarriers have emerged as a promising cancer drug delivery strategy.Multi-drug resistance caused by overexpression of multiple-drug excretiontransporters in tumor cells is the major obstacle to successful chemotherapy.Vitamin E derivatives have many essential functions for drug deliveryapplications , such as biological components that are hydrophobic , stable ,water-soluble enhancing compounds , and anticancer activity. In addition , vitaminE derivatives are also effective mitocan which can overcome multi-drug resistanceby binding to P glycoproteins. Here , we developed a carboxymethylchitosan/vitamin E succinate nano-micellar system (O-CMCTS-VES). The synthesizedpolymers were characterized by Fourier Transform IR , and (1)H NMR spectra. Themean sizes of O-CMCTS-VES and DOX-loaded nanoparticles were around 177 nm and208 nm. The drug loading contents were 6.1% , 13.0% and 10.6% with the weightratio of DOX to O-CMCTS-VES corresponding 1:10 , 2:10 and 3:10 , and thecorresponding EEs were 64.3% , 74.5% and 39.7%. Cytotoxicity test , hemolysis testand histocompatibility test showed that it had good biocompatibility in vitro andin vivo. Drug release experiments implied good pH sensitivity andsustained-release effect. The DOX/O-CMCTS-VES nanoparticles can be efficientlytaken up by HepG2 cancer cells and the tumor inhibition rate is up to 62.57%. Inthe in vivo study by using H22 cells implanted Balb/C mice , DOX/O-CMCTS-VESreduced the tumor volume and weight efficiently with a TIR of 35.58%. The newlydeveloped polymeric micelles could successfully be utilized as a nanocarriersystem for hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid tumors.

AB  - Effective disease-modifying treatments are an urgent need for Parkinson's disease(PD). A putative successful strategy is to counteract oxidative stress , not onlywith synthetic compounds , but also with natural agents or dietary choices.Vitamin E , in particular , is a powerful antioxidant , commonly found in vegetablesand other components of the diet. In this work , we performed a questionnairebased case-control study on 100 PD patients and 100 healthy controls. Theanalysis showed that a higher dietary intake of Vitamin E was inverselyassociated with PD occurrence independently from age and gender (OR = 1.022; 95%CI = 0.999-1.045; p < 0.05) , though unrelated to clinical severity. Then , inorder to provide a mechanistic explanation for such observation , we tested theeffects of Vitamin E and other alimentary antioxidants in vitro , by utilizing thehomozygous PTEN-induced kinase 1 knockout (PINK1 (-/-)) mouse model of PD. PINK1(-/-) mice exhibit peculiar alterations of synaptic plasticity at corticostriatalsynapses , consisting in the loss of both long-term potentiation (LTP) andlong-term depression (LTD) , in the absence of overt neurodegeneration. Chronicadministration of Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol and the water-soluble analogtrolox) fully restored corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in PINK1 (-/-) mice ,suggestive of a specific protective action. Vitamin E might indeed compensatePINK1 haploinsufficiency and mitochondrial impairment , reverting some centralsteps of the pathogenic process. Altogether , both clinical and experimentalfindings suggest that Vitamin E could be a potential , useful agent for PDpatients. These data , although preliminary , may encourage future confirmatorytrials.

AB  - The goal of this work aimed to evaluate the protective effects of pea (Pisumsativum) peels extract versus doxorubicin-induced oxidative myocardial injury inmale mice. The mice were divided into seven groups (n = 7): (I) control group;(II) P. sativum 250 group; (III) P. sativum 500 group; (IV) DOX (3 timesalternately of 2.5 mg/kg/week , i.p. for a continuous two-week period) group; (V)Vit. E 100 + DOX group; (VI) P. sativum 250 + DOX group , and (VII) P. sativum500 + DOX group). Twenty polyphenolic compounds , mainly flavonoid glycosides suchas quercetin , kaempferol apigenin , and phenolics compounds were characterized byLC-MS/MS analysis in the examined extract. DOX administration elevated theactivities of serum biomarkers of myocardial dysfunction (ALT , AST , ALP , LDH ,troponin , CPK , and CK-MB) , lipid profile , and proinflammatory cytokines. Also , itdecreased cardiac antioxidants (GSH , SOD , GPX , CAT) and increased myocardialmarkers of oxidative stress (NO and MDA) and inflammatory marker (MPO). As wellas it downregulated and upregulated the Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic gene) and the Bax(pro-apoptotic gene) expressions , respectively. Pre-treatment of DOX-exposed micewith P. sativum or vitamin E (as a reference protective antioxidant) alleviatedthe changes dose-dependently via DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. These data show thatP. sativum has a cardio-protective impact against DOX-induced cardiomyocytedamage in mice via boosting endogenous antioxidants , decreasing inflammation , andregulating BcL-2 and Bax apoptosis pathway , which might be related to thepresence of flavonoid glycosides. P. sativum peels are a by-product that could besuggested for further screening as a possible new candidate for therapeutic use.

AB  - Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble nutrient mainly found in vegetable oils ,nuts , and other foods. In this study , we evaluated the contribution of commonlyconsumed foods to the vitamin E dietary intake of the population in relation totheir consumption practices. In addition , the vitamin E intakes of Chineseresidents were compared in different regions of China and in different years. Theresults showed that vegetable oil was the main source of vitamin E dietary intakefor Chinese residents , accounting for 46.76% of total dietary intake of vitaminE , followed by cereals , vegetables , meat , aquatic products , eggs , legumes , nuts ,fruits and dairy products. Among all vegetable oils , rapeseed oil was the highestcontributor of vitamin E , accounting for 10.73% of all foods. Due to dietaryhabits and regional differences , vitamin E intake also varies greatly amongresidents in different regions of China and has increased yearly from 1982 to2020. This study provides with scientific evidence for reasonable VEsupplementation.

TI  - Effects of Vitamin E and Coenzyme Q(10) Supplementation on Oxidative StressParameters in Untrained Leisure Horses Subjected to Acute Moderate Exercise.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10060908 [doi]
LID - 908
AB  - The effects of antioxidant supplements on exercise-induced oxidative stress havenot been investigated in untrained leisure horses. We investigated the effects of14-day supplementation with vitamin E (1.8 IU/kg/day) , coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10);ubiquinone; 800 mg/day) , and a combination of both (the same doses as inmono-supplementation) on the blood levels of CoQ(10) , vitamin E , and oxidativestress parameters in untrained leisure horses subjected to acute moderateexercise. Correlations between lipid peroxidation and muscle enzyme leakage werealso determined. Forty client-owned horses were included in the study , with 10horses in each of the antioxidant and placebo (paraffin oil) groups. Bloodparameters were measured before supplementation , before and immediately afterexercise , and after 24 h of rest. The differences in individual parametersbetween blood collection times and groups were analysed with linear mixed models(p ˂ 0.05). None of the supplemented antioxidants affected vitamin E and CoQ(10)concentrations , oxidative stress parameters , or serum muscle enzymes. Lipidperoxidation occurred in horses supplemented with placebo and CoQ(10) but not inhorses supplemented with vitamin E or the combination of both antioxidants. Theseresults suggest that vitamin E alone or in combination with CoQ(10) preventedlipid peroxidation in untrained leisure horses subjected to acute moderateexercise.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF REALSIL (SILYBIN-PHOSPHOLIPID-VITAMIN E COMPLEX) ON LIVER ENZYMESIN PATIENTS WITH NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD) OR NON-ALCOHOLICSTEATO-HEPATITIS (NASH): A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RCTS.
PG  - 223-231
LID - 10.4183/aeb.2020.223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effectsof Realsil (silybin-phospholipid-vitamin E complex) on liver enzymes in patientswith NAFLD or NASH. METHODS: We searched Web of Science , MEDLINE , Google Scholar ,Cochrane Library , Science Direct , ProQuest , Scopus , and 1868 articles were foundup to December 2018. Four studies that examined the effect of Realsil intake onliver enzymes among NAFLD or NASH patients were included. Exclusion criteriainclude: animal studies , studies with the design other than clinical trials ,studies on non-adult individuals , studies that assess the effect of vitamin E ,silybin , or phospholipid solely , studies that examined the effect of Realsil onother outcomes , or studies with insufficient data. RESULTS: The analysisdemonstrated that Realsil intake led to a significant decrease in Gamma-GlutamylTranspeptidase (GGT) levels (standardized mean difference (SMD) =-0.37; 95%confidence interval (CI]): -0.68 to -0.06). Realsil intake non-significantlydecrease alanine transaminase (ALT) levels (SMD=-1.02 U/L; 95% CI: -2.23 to 0.20)and non-significantly increase aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (SMD =0.17 U/L; 95% CI: -0.26-0.61). CONCLUSION: Realsil intake was associated with asignificantly decreased circulating GGT level without any significant effect onAST and ALT levels.

AB  - The effectiveness of using serum vitamin concentrations as biomarkers to predictdiseases in dairy cows during the periparturient period is not well known. Theobjective of this study was to evaluate the association between serum β-carotene ,retinol , and α-tocopherol concentrations and periparturient cow diseases incommercial dairies. We measured serum concentrations of these vitamin-activecompounds at dry-off and during close-up (approximately 3 wk before calving) andearly lactation (approximately 7 d post-calving) , and we examined theirassociation with clinical diseases in the first 30 d in milk. Diseases werediagnosed by trained personnel and recorded using database software. Bloodsamples were taken from 353 cows from 5 different farms over a 3-yr period. Bloodsamples were analyzed for β-carotene , retinol , α-tocopherol , and cholesterol. Webuilt separate mixed logistic regression models for each disease outcome:hyperketonuria , lameness , mastitis , uterine diseases (retained placenta ormetritis) , and an aggregate outcome. For the aggregate outcome , a cow wasconsidered positive if she had one or more of the following: hyperketonuria ,lameness , mastitis , uterine disease , pneumonia , milk fever , or displacedabomasum. Concentrations of all 3 fat-soluble vitamins decreased significantly inearly lactation relative to the 2 prepartum sampling times. Serum retinolconcentrations at close-up and early lactation were negatively associated withodds of developing postpartum hyperketonuria. At early lactation , cows withuterine disease had lower serum retinol concentrations than cows without uterinedisease. Similarly , lower serum retinol concentrations were associated withgreater odds of having any one disease in the aggregate outcome. First-test 305-dmature-equivalent milk yield was positively correlated with increased serumα-tocopherol and negatively correlated with β-carotene concentrations. This studydemonstrates the potential for serum β-carotene , retinol , and α-tocopherol toserve as biomarkers for disease risk.

TI  - The Role of Vitamin E in Protecting against Oxidative Stress , Inflammation , andthe Neurotoxic Effects of Acute Paracetamol in Pregnant Female Rats.
LID - 10.3390/toxics11040368 [doi]
LID - 368
AB  - Paracetamol (acetaminophen , APAP) is the most common non-prescription analgesicdrug used during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectof vitamin E on acute APAP toxicity in pregnant rats. Toxicity in the liver ,kidney , and brain (hippocampus , cerebellum , and olfactory bulb) was examined.Twenty pregnant female Wistar rats at gestational day 18 were used. Pregnant ratswere divided into four groups: Control , APAP , E + APAP , and APAP + E. The Controlgroup was treated with 0.5 mL p.o. corn oil. The APAP group received 3000 mg/kgp.o. APAP. The E + APAP group received 300 mg/kg p.o. vitamin E one hour before3000 mg/kg APAP. The APAP + E group received 3000 mg/kg paracetamol one hourbefore 300 mg/kg p.o. vitamin E. Twenty-four hours after the last treatmentadministration , rats were euthanized and blood , brain , liver , and kidney sampleswere collected. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) , aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ,blood urea nitrogen (BUN) , creatinine levels , uric acid (UA) , and superoxidedismutase (SOD) levels , as well as the relative mRNA expression of Cyp1a4 ,Cyp2d6 , and Nat2 , were determined. Acute APAP treatment upregulated ALT , AST ,BUN , and creatinine levels. APAP treatment downregulated UA and SOD levels. APAPtreatment upregulated the relative mRNA expression of Cyp1a4 and Cyp2d6 , butdownregulated Nat2 expression. Vitamin E treatment , either before or after APAPadministration , attenuated the toxic effects of APAP.

TI  - Vitamin E Delivery Systems Increase Resistance to Oxidative Stress in Red DeerSperm Cells: Hydrogel and Nanoemulsion Carriers.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10111780 [doi]
LID - 1780
AB  - Oxidative stress has become a major concern in the field of spermatology , and oneof the possible solutions to this acute problem would be the use of antioxidantprotection; however , more studies are required in this field , as highlycontradictory results regarding the addition of antioxidants have been obtained.Vitamin E is a powerful biological antioxidant , but its low stability and highhydrophobicity limit its application in spermatology , making the use of organicsolvents necessary , which renders spermatozoa practically motionless. Keepingthis in mind , we propose the use of hydrogels (HVEs) and nanoemulsions (NVEs) ,alone or in combination , as carriers for the controlled release of vitamin E ,thus , improving its solubility and stability and preventing oxidative stress insperm cells. Cryopreserved sperm from six stags was thawed and extended to 30 ×10(6) sperm/mL in Bovine Gamete Medium (BGM). Once aliquoted , the samples wereincubated as follows: control , free vitamin E (1 mM) , NVEs (9 mM) , HVEs (1 mM) ,and the combination of HVEs and NVEs (H + N) , with or without induced oxidativestress (100 µM Fe(2+)/ascorbate). The different treatments were analyzed after 0 ,2 , 5 , and 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Motility (CASA(®)) , viability(YO-PRO-1/IP) , mitochondrial membrane potential (Mitotracker Deep Red 633) , lipidperoxidation (C(11) BODIPY 581/591) , intracellular reactive oxygen speciesproduction (CM-H(2)DCFDA) , and DNA status (SCSA(®)) were assessed. Our resultsshow that the deleterious effects of exogenous oxidative stress were prevented bythe vitamin E-loaded carriers proposed , while the kinematic sperm parameters (p ˂0.05) and sperm viability were always preserved. Moreover , the vitamin Eformulations maintained and preserved mitochondrial activity , prevented spermlipid peroxidation , and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (p ˂0.05) under oxidative stress conditions. Vitamin E formulations weresignificantly different as regards the free vitamin E samples (p < 0.001) , whosesperm kinematic parameters drastically decreased. This is the first time thatvitamin E has been formulated as hydrogels. This new formulation could be highlyrelevant for sperm physiology preservation , signifying an excellent approachagainst sperm oxidative damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The production of stress oxidative condition in body which is causedby consumption of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) leads to aliver damage. As an antioxidant , Vitamin E can protect cells and tissues againstthe deleterious effects of free radicals. This study evaluates the protectiveeffects of Vitamin E on MDMA induced liver toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Twenty-eight male albino mice were randomly assigned to four equal groups. Group1 received saline (control) , Group 2 received MDMA and saline , Group 3 receivedMDMA , and Vitamin E and Group 4 received Vitamin E. MDMA was injected with singledaily dose , three sequential days/week for 5 weeks. At the end of the period ,blood samples were collected for a biochemical analysis and then the mice weresacrificed by cervical dislocation for histopathological and biochemicalexaminations of liver. RESULTS: The administration of Vitamin E attenuated theincreased levels of alanine transaminase , aspartate transaminase , and alkalinephosphatase enzymes in serum. Vitamin E treatments significantly restoredendogenous antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutaseenzyme) activities as compared with MDMA-treated animals. Histologicalexamination of liver revealed significant morphological tissue injuries inhepatocytes after MDMA being used , but in coadministration of vitamin E and MDMA ,these morphological alterations reduced. CONCLUSION: The study showed that MDMAadministration has adverse effects on the liver. Vitamin E lessened thedeleterious impact considerably.

TI  - Functional dissection of HGGT and HPT in barley vitamin E biosynthesis viaCRISPR/Cas9-enabled genome editing.
PG  - 929-942
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcaa115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin E (tocochromanol) is a lipid-soluble antioxidant andan essential nutrient for human health. Among cereal crops , barley (Hordeumvulgare) contains a high level of vitamin E , which includes both tocopherols andtocotrienols. Although the vitamin E biosynthetic pathway has been characterizedin dicots , such as Arabidopsis , which only accumulate tocopherols , knowledgeregarding vitamin E biosynthesis in monocots is limited because of the lack offunctional mutants. This study aimed to obtain gene knockout mutants to elucidatethe genetic control of vitamin E composition in barley. METHODS: Targetedknockout mutations of HvHPT and HvHGGT in barley were created withCRISPR/Cas9-enabled genome editing. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)was performed to analyse the content of tocochromanol isomers in transgene-freehomozygous Hvhpt and Hvhggt mutants. KEY RESULTS: Mutagenesis efficiency among T0regenerated plantlets was 50-65 % as a result of two simultaneously expressedguide RNAs targeting each gene; most of the mutations were stably inherited bythe next generation. The transgene-free homozygous mutants of Hvhpt and Hvhggtexhibited decreased grain size and weight , and the HvHGGT mutation led to ashrunken phenotype and significantly lower total starch content in grains. HPLCanalysis revealed that targeted mutation of HvHPT significantly reduced thecontent of both tocopherols and tocotrienols , whereas mutations in HvHGGTcompletely blocked tocotrienol biosynthesis in barley grains. Transientoverexpression of an HvHPT homologue in tobacco leaves significantly increasedthe production of γ- and δ-tocopherols , which may partly explain why targetedmutation of HvHPT in barley grains did not eliminate tocopherol production.CONCLUSIONS: Our results functionally validated that HvHGGT is the only committedgene for the production of tocotrienols , whereas HvHPT is partly responsible fortocopherol biosynthesis in barley.

TI  - Oxidative stress in rat brain during experimental status epilepticus: effect ofantioxidants.
PG  - 1233184

LID - 1233184
AB  - Antioxidants have been proposed as a treatment for diseases of the centralnervous system. However , few studies actually studied their effects in the brain.To test central actions of antioxidants , we used the lithium-pilocarpine(Li-Pilo) model of status epilepticus (SE) in the rat in which seizures areaccompanied by significant oxidative stress. We used in vivo microdialysis todetermine isoprostane levels during SE in real time and brain homogenates forother measures of oxidative stress. Six different antioxidants were tested inacute and preventive experiments (vitamin C , vitamin E , ebselen , resveratrol ,n-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone and coenzyme Q10). None of the antioxidants had aneffect when given acutely during SE. In contrast , when antioxidants were givenfor 3 days prior to seizure induction , vitamins C and E reduced isoprostaneformation by 58% and 65% , respectively. Pretreatment with the other antioxidantswas ineffective. In brain homogenates prepared after 90 min of seizures , SEdecreased the ratio of reduced vs. oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG ratio) from60.8 to 7.50 and caused a twofold increase of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine(8-OHdG) levels and protein carbonyls. Pretreatment with vitamin C or vitamin Emitigated these effects and increased the GSH/GSSG ratio to 23.9 and 28.3 ,respectively. Again , the other antioxidants were not effective. We conclude thatpreventive treatment with vitamin C or vitamin E ameliorates seizure-inducedoxidative damage in the brain. Several well-studied antioxidants were inactive ,possibly due to limited brain permeability or a lack of chain-breakingantioxidant activity in hydrophilic compounds.

AB  - Intense physical activity can induce metabolic changes that modify specificbiochemical biomarkers. In this scenario , the purpose of our study was toevaluate how intense physical activity can affect oxidative metabolism. Followingthis , fifteen professional basketball players and fifteen sedentary controls wererecruited and subjected to two samplings of serum and urine in the pre-season(September) and two months after the start of the competitive season (November).Our results have shown an increase in athletes compared to controls in CK and LDHin September (respectively , p-value 0.003 and p-value < 0.001) and in November(both p-value < 0.001) , whereas ALT is increased only in November (p-value 0.09).GGT serum levels were decreased in athletes compared to controls in both months(in September p-value 0.001 and in November p-value < 0.001). A gene expressionanalysis , carried out using RT-PCR , has revealed that IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , xCT andGCLM are increased in athletes in both months (p-value < 0.0001) , while IL-10 andCHAC1 are increased only in September if compared to the controls (respectively ,p-value 0.040 and p-value < 0.001). In conclusion , physical activity creates anadaptation of the systems involved in oxidative metabolism but without causingdamage to the liver or kidney. This information could be of help to sportsdoctors for the prevention of injuries and illnesses in professional athletes forthe construction of the athlete's passport.

AB  - Red palm-pressed mesocarp olein (PPMO) contains plenty of naturally occurringphytonutrients. However , the application of PPMO in food is limited due to thelack of scientific data. In the study , stability and degradation kinetics ofcarotenoid and vitamin E in PPMO under two storage temperature , 23°C (with andwithout light) and 35℃ (without light) , for a period of twelve months wereperformed. Amber bottles were used for optimum protection against damaging UVlight. Both temperature and light conditions significantly influenced the totalcarotenoid and vitamin E contents of PPMO , as well as oil quality in terms ofperoxide value and anisidine value to a different extent. Correlation analysisshowed that oil quality was significantly but negatively correlated withphytonutrients. In addition , both zero- and first-order kinetic models were ableto describe the degradation kinetics of the phytonutrients in PPMO. Zero-orderwas the best fit with higher correlation coefficients (R(2)) for both carotenoidand vitamin E contents , except for carotenoid that was kept at 23°C wherebyfirst-order displayed the best fit. The half-life of carotenoid and vitamin E inPPMO were 40.8 months and 21.6 months , respectively under the optimised storagecondition (23°C in amber bottles). In conclusion , storage of PPMO at lowertemperature and in light-limited environment could effectively lower itsoxidation rate and degradation rate of carotenoid and vitamin E , postulating itsshelf life to be prolonged.

PG  - 1025-1030
LID - 10.2174/1871530321666210101165648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: College students may have a risk of fat-soluble vitamin deficienciesdue to unhealthy dietary habits , especially for vitamin A and E. They areimportant members of the human antioxidant network; deficiencies of thesevitamins may increase the risk of many critical diseases. OBJECTIVE: The currentstudy was undertaken to determine the status of vitamin A and E in collegestudents. METHODS: Healthy college students were recruited , and fasting bloodsamples of them were collected and used for determining serum levels of retinoland α-tocopherol by the HPLC method. RESULTS: We found that there was no vitaminA deficiency in college students. However , vitamin E deficiency existed in 34.5%of college students , especially in males. All the students had no vitamin Eadequacy. In addition , our findings showed that BMI was inversely associated withserum α-- tocopherol , but not serum retinol. CONCLUSION: These results suggestthat vitamin E deficiency in college students should be given more attention , andit is necessary to consider using vitamin E supplements.

AB  - Hepatic oxidative stress , as one important mechanism of cadmium (Cd)-inducedhepatic toxicity , could , as known , be ameliorated by vitamin E (VE). However , theunderlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. To investigate whether theantioxidant vitamin E can protect against Cd-induced sub-chronic liver injuryassociated with oxidative stress and nuclear factor erythrocyte 2-related factor2 (Nrf2) pathway , male Sprague-Dawley rats (nine-week-old) were randomly dividedinto four groups (eight rats/group) , namely , control , VE (100 mg/kg VE) , Cd(5 mg/kg CdCl(2)) and VE+Cd (100 mg/kg VE+5 mg/kg CdCl(2)) , and receivedintragastric administration of Cd and/or VE for four weeks. Cd-exposure aloneresulted in reduced liver weight , liver histological alteration and oxidativestress , accumulation of Cd in the liver , elevated ALT and AST concentrations inserum together with decreased mRNA and protein expressions of Nrf2 pathwayrelated molecules (Nrf2 , HO-1 , NQO-1 , GCLC , GCLM and GST). However , theco-treatment of Cd and VE significantly ameliorated the changes mentioned above ,and promoted the expression of genes and proteins of Nrf2 pathway relatedmolecules in comparison to the Cd-exposure alone. Our results indicate that theprotective effect of VE against Cd-induced sub-chronic hepatic damage in rats isassociated with the inhibition of oxidative stress and activation of Nrf2pathway.

TI  - Associations Between Antioxidant Vitamin Status , Dietary Intake , andRetinol-binding Protein 4 Levels in Prepubertal Obese Children After 3-monthWeight Loss Therapy.
PG  - 187-197
LID - 10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2020.2020.0207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiposity is associated with increased oxidative stress , leading tochanged fat-soluble vitamin concentrations. The aim of this study was todetermine whether weight loss alters fat-soluble vitamin status and whether thesealterations are associated with dietary intake , anthropometric parameters andadipokines in obese children. METHODS: Vitamin A and E concentrations weremeasured using high-pressure liquid chromatography in 60 obese children beforeand after weight loss therapy. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) , leptin , solubleleptin receptor (sOB-R) , and high molecular weight adiponectin concentrationswere determined by immunoenzymatic assays. RESULTS: The intake of vitamin E waslower in obese children with weight loss after therapy (p=0.038). In this group ,an increase was found in the vitamin A/lipids (p=0.022) and the vitamin E/lipids(p=0.008) ratios but due to the reduction in triglyceride levels. In the obesegroup , changes in vitamin E level were positively correlated with changes indietary vitamin E (p=0.017) and the leptin/sOB-R ratio (p=0.046). Changes invitamin A level were positively correlated with changes in dietary vitamin A(p=0.001) and RBP4 concentration (p=0.023). Associations between changes in RBP4level with the changes in body mass index (BMI) (p=0.011) and total cholesterolconcentration (p=0.023) but not with changes in vitamin A concentration werefound in the obese after therapy. CONCLUSION: An increased risk of vitamin Edeficiency may occur in children losing weight during lifestyle intervention.Changes in BMI value may influence changes in RBP4 concentrations andconsequently the vitamin A status in obese children after therapy.

TI  - Atorvastatin and Vitamin E Accelerates NASH Resolution by Dietary Intervention ina Preclinical Guinea Pig Model.
LID - 10.3390/nu11112834 [doi]
LID - 2834
AB  - Despite affecting millions of patients worldwide , no pharmacological treatmenthas yet proved effective against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) inducedliver fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications includingreductions in dietary energy intake. Recently , therapy with atorvastatin andvitamin E (vitE) has been recommended , although clinical studies on theresolution of hepatic fibrosis are inconclusive. Targeting NASH-induced hepaticend-points , this study evaluated the effects of atorvastatin and vitE alone or incombination with a dietary intervention in the guinea pig NASH model. Guinea pigs(n = 72) received 20 weeks of high fat feeding before allocating to four groups:continued HF feeding (HF) , HF diet with atorvastatin and vitE (HF+) , low-fat diet(LF) and low-fat with atorvastatin and vitE (LF+) , for four or eight weeks ofintervention. Both LF and LF+ decreased liver weight , cholesterol and plasmadyslipidemia. LF+ further improved hepatic histopathological hallmarks (p <0.05) , liver injury markers aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanineaminotransferase (ALT) (p < 0.05) and reduced the expression of target genes ofhepatic inflammation and fibrosis (p < 0.05) , underlining an increased effect onNASH resolution in this group. Collectively , the data support an overallbeneficial effect of diet change , and indicate that atorvastatin and vitE therapycombined with a diet change act synergistically in improving NASH-inducedendpoints.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary hazelnut skin (HNS) , aby-product of confectionery industry , on the oxidative stability of lamb meat.Twenty-two finishing lambs were randomly assigned to 2 groups and fed ad libitumfor 56 days on different concentrate-based diets: one control and oneexperimental , in which 150 g/kg of corn was replaced by HNS. After slaughter , thefat-soluble vitamins content and hydrophilic antioxidant capacity were assessedin fresh meat , as well as color , lipid and protein stability over 7 days ofshelf-life trial. Dietary HNS increased (P < 0.001) the tocopherols content ofmeat and reduced (P < 0.001) lipid oxidation during 7 days of refrigeratedstorage. Meat from lambs fed HNS showed different (P < 0.05) instrumental colorparameters. No diet effect (P > 0.05) was observed on the development ofmetmyoglobin , hydroperoxides , thiol groups , and carbonyl groups. Feeding HNS tolambs improves the oxidative stability of raw meat by delaying lipid oxidationthanks to the antioxidant molecules (tocopherols and phenolic compounds)contained in this by-product.

TI  - Metabolomic Associations with Serum Bone Turnover Markers.
LID - 10.3390/nu12103161 [doi]
LID - 3161
AB  - Bone is a dynamic tissue that is in a constant state of remodeling. Bone turnovermarkers (BTMs) , procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and C-terminaltelopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) , provide sensitive measures of boneformation and resorption , respectively. This study used ultra-high-resolutionmetabolomics (HRM) to determine plasma metabolic pathways and targetedmetabolites related to the markers of bone resorption and formation in adults.This cross-sectional clinical study included 34 adults (19 females , mean 27.8years) , without reported illnesses , recruited from a US metropolitan area. SerumBTM levels were quantified by an ELISA. Plasma HRM utilized dual-column liquidchromatography and mass spectrometry to identify metabolites and metabolicpathways associated with BTMs. Metabolites significantly associated with P1NP (p< 0.05) were significantly enriched in pathways linked to the TCA cycle , pyruvatemetabolism , and metabolism of B vitamins important for energy production (e.g. ,niacin , thiamin). Other nutrition-related metabolic pathways associated with P1NPwere amino acid (proline , arginine , glutamate) and vitamin C metabolism , whichare important for collagen formation. Metabolites associated with CTX levels (p <0.05) were enriched within lipid and fatty acid beta-oxidation metabolicpathways , as well as fat-soluble micronutrient pathways including , vitamin Dmetabolism , vitamin E metabolism , and bile acid biosynthesis. P1NP and CTX weresignificantly related to microbiome-related metabolites (p < 0.05).Macronutrient-related pathways including lipid , carbohydrate , and amino acidmetabolism , as well as several gut microbiome-derived metabolites weresignificantly related to BTMs. Future research should compare metabolism BTMsrelationships reported here to aging and clinical populations to inform targetedtherapeutic interventions.

TI  - Investigation on the changes in concentrations of vitamin D3 and E in Honamli andhair goat breed' colostrum in early postpartum.
PG  - 625-633
LID - 10.17236/sat00365 [doi]
AB  - Colostrum contains higher amounts of vitamins D3 and E than mature milk. Due tothe structural feature of the goat placenta , goat kids are born with very lowreserves of fat-soluble vitamins and must rely on colostrum to acquire adequateplasma levels of vitamin D3 and vitamin E. In the present study , vitamin E wasmeasured in the form of α-tocopherol which is the most dominant isoform presentin milk samples. The main aim of the present study is to determine the colostrumvitamin D3 and E content in Honamli and hair goats in the early postpartum stageby high-performance liquid chromatography. Five Honamli and five hair goatcolostrum samples were collected on the day of kidding and on the third and fifthdays postpartum. On the sampled days , the colostrum of both goat breeds containshigher concentrations of vitamin D3 and α-tocopherol than that in mature milk (p<0,05) and there was the existence of a breed difference in colostrum vitamin D3and α-tocopherol concentrations (p< 0,05) was determined. Also , the effect ofsampling day on colostrum vitamin D3 concentration in samples that were obtainedbetween the first and third days was also significant (p< 0,05). Hair goatcolostrum α-tocopherol concentrations were found to be higher than Honamli goats(p< 0,05). Additionally , there was a statistically significant difference betweenthe sampling day and α-tocopherol content on days one and five (p < 0,05).

TI  - Association between fat-soluble vitamins and self-reported health status: across-sectional analysis of the MARK-AGE cohort.

AB  - Self-rated health (SRH) is associated with higher risk of death. Since low plasmalevels of fat-soluble vitamins are related to mortality , we aimed to assesswhether plasma concentrations of vitamins A , D and E were associated with SRH inthe MARK-AGE study. We included 3158 participants (52 % female) aged between 35and 75 years. Cross-sectional data were collected via questionnaires. An enzymeimmunoassay quantified 25-hydroxyvitamin D and HPLC determined α-tocopherol andretinol plasma concentrations. The median 25-hydroxyvitamin D and retinolconcentrations differed significantly (P < 0·001) between SRH categories and werelower in the combined fair/poor category v. the excellent , very good and goodcategories (25-hydroxvitamin D: 40·8 v. 51·9 , 49·3 , 46·7 nmol/l , respectively;retinol: 1·67 v. 1·75 , 1·74 , 1·70 µmol/l , respectively). Both vitamin D andretinol status were independently associated with fair/poor SRH in multipleregression analyses: adjusted OR (95 % CI) for the vitamin D insufficiency ,deficiency and severe deficiency categories were 1·33 (1·06-1·68) , 1·50(1·17-1·93) and 1·83 (1·34-2·50) , respectively; P = 0·015 , P = 0·001 and P <0·001 , and for the second/third/fourth retinol quartiles: 1·44 (1·18-1·75) , 1·57(1·28-1·93) and 1·49 (1·20-1·84); all P < 0·001. No significant associations werereported for α-tocopherol quartiles. Lower vitamin A and D status emerged asindependent markers for fair/poor SRH. Further insights into the long-termimplications of these modifiable nutrients on health status are warranted.

TI  - Vitamin A and D Absorption in Adults with Metabolic Syndrome versus HealthyControls: A Pilot Study Utilizing Targeted and Untargeted LC-MS Lipidomics.
PG  - e2000413
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.202000413 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Persons with metabolic syndrome (MetS) absorb less vitamin E than healthycontrols. It is hypothesized that absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (FSV) A andD(2) would also decrease with MetS status and that trends would be reflected inlipidomic responses between groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following soymilkconsumption (501 IU vitamin A , 119 IU vitamin D(2) ) , the triglyceride-richlipoprotein fractions (TRL) from MetS and healthy subjects (n = 10 age- andgender-matched subjects/group) are assessed using LC-MS/MS. Absorption iscalculated using area under the time-concentration curves (AUC) from samplescollected at 0 , 3 , and 6 h post-ingestion. MetS subjects have ≈6.4-fold highermedian vitamin A AUC (retinyl palmitate) versus healthy controls (P = 0.07).Vitamin D(2) AUC is unaffected by MetS status (P = 0.48). Untargeted LC-MSlipidomics reveals six phospholipids and one cholesterol ester withconcentrations correlating (r = 0.53-0.68; P < 0.001) with vitamin Aconcentration. CONCLUSIONS: The vitamin A-phospholipid association suggestsincreased hydrolysis by PLB , PLRP2 , and/or PLA(2) IB may be involved in the trendin higher vitamin A bioavailability in MetS subjects. Previously observeddifferences in circulating levels of these vitamins are likely not due toabsorption. Alternate strategies should be investigated to improve FSV status inMetS.

AB  - Fatty liver involves ectopic lipid accumulation and dysregulated hepaticoxidative metabolism , which can progress to a state of elevated inflammation andfibrosis referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The factors thatcontrol progression from simple steatosis to NASH are not fully known. Here , wetested the hypothesis that dietary vitamin E (VitE) supplementation would preventNASH progression and associated metabolic alterations induced by a Western diet(WD). Hyperphagic melanocortin-4 receptor-deficient (MC4R(-/-)) mice were fedchow , chow+VitE , WD , or WD+VitE starting at 8 or 20 weeks of age. All groupsexhibited extensive hepatic steatosis by the end of the study (28 weeks of age).WD feeding exacerbated liver disease severity without inducing proportionalchanges in liver triglycerides. Eight weeks of WD accelerated liver pyruvatecycling , and 20 weeks of WD extensively upregulated liver glucose and oxidativemetabolism assessed by (2)H/(13)C flux analysis. VitE supplementation failed toreduce the histological features of NASH. Rather , WD+VitE increased the abundanceand saturation of liver ceramides and accelerated metabolic flux dysregulationcompared with 8 weeks of WD alone. In summary , VitE did not limit NASHpathogenesis in genetically obese mice , but instead increased some indicators ofmetabolic dysfunction.

TI  - Serum Metabolic Characterization of Vitamin E Deficiency in Holstein Cows duringthe Transition Period Based on Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
LID - 10.3390/ani13182957 [doi]
LID - 2957
AB  - Vitamin E , a potent antioxidant , is a necessary and complex micronutrient forcows. During the transition period , vitamin E deficiency (VED) is among thehighest prevalent micronutrient deficits in dairy cows. It may eventually resultin oxidative stress and immunological malfunction , and it increases the risk ofperipartum disorders. At present , detailed data on blood metabolites in VED cowsare limited. Consequently , the purpose of this research was to examine thealterations in the serum metabolic profile of VED cows throughout the earlypostpartum period. Using comprehensive (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)HNMR) , the alterations in serum metabolic activities of VED cows were analyzed. Intotal , 28 multiparous Holstein cows were assigned according to serum α-tocopherol(α-Toc) concentrations into normal (α-Toc ≥ 4 μg/mL , n = 14) and VED (α-Toc < 3μg/mL , n = 14) groups at 21 days postpartum , and their blood samples werecollected for biochemical and (1)H NMR analyses. A t-test on independent samplesas well as multivariate statistics were used to assess the findings. Incomparison with normal cows , VED cows showed significantly worse body conditionscores , milk yield , and dry matter intake (p < 0.05). Significantly higher levelsof serum non-esterified fatty acids , aspartate aminotransferase , low-densitylipoprotein , and malonaldehyde were found in VED-affected cows , as well as lesserconcentrations of serum albumin , high-density lipoprotein , and total antioxidantcapacity in comparison with normal cows (p < 0.01) , while other vitamins andminerals concentrations showed no distinction between the groups (p > 0.05).Furthermore , 24 upregulated serum metabolites were identified under VEDconditions. The metabolomics pathway analysis of these metabolites demonstratedthat a global metabolic response to VED in cows was represented by changes in 11metabolic pathways , comprising energy , carbohydrate , and amino acid metabolism.From these results , we conclude that VED cows were more likely to experience anegative energy balance characterized by alterations of common systemic metabolicprocesses and develop oxidative stress , inflammation , and ultimately liverinjury. This study provides the first evidence of metabolic changes in cows withVED.

TI  - The Influence of Rumen-Protected Choline and α-tocopherol Supplementation onEarly Lactating Dairy Cows Metabolism.
PG  - 1165-1171
LID - 10.22092/ARI.2022.358740.2298 [doi]
AB  - It is well documented that choline is known as one of the essential ingredientsof phospholipids. Choline acts as a determinative element for appropriate cellmembrane functions. On the other hand α-tocopherol (Vit E) is a fat-solublevitamin. This vitamin acts as a strong antioxidant in the living body's defensesystem against oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation in peripartum and earlylactating cows is significantly increased while the level of serum Vit E isdecreases dramatically. These concomitant physiological changes demonstrate ahigher level of oxidative stress subsequently leads to serious health issues indairy cows. Therefore , the present research was designed to investigate thefollowing items in dairy cattle: 1) evaluation of the possible changes in serumprotein fractions , and 2) comparing the oxidative status of orally RPC andvitamin E supplementation in dairy cows in early lactation period. In the currentstudy 30 early lactating primiparous and multiparous Holstein cows (bodycondition score (BCS)=2.51 ± 0.10) were used beginning five weeks postpartum. Allthe animals were randomly divided in to three groups (n=10) (number oflactation=2.61). The animals were randomly assigned to receive one of thefollowing treatments. Group 1 served as control group were not received anysupplement. The second group was supplemented with 90 g/d of RPC (ReashreCholine , Balchem , USA). The third group was administrated 4400 IU/d vitamin E(Roche , Vitamins Ltd; Switzerland). In the current study , serum proteinelectrophoresis showed four main fractions as follows: albumin , α-globulin ,β-globulin , and γ-globulin. The recorded data showed that the percentages ofalbumin and γ-globulin fractions were higher in treated groups compared to thecontrol group. In the animals supplementing with RPC and vitamin E thepercentages of serum albumin increased to the value of 37. 70±1.63 and 38.21±1.28respectively compare to the control group (34.69±1.21) , which were significant(P<0.05).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fecal incontinence (FI) is caused by external anal sphincterinjury. Vitamin E is a potential strategy for anal sphincter muscle repair viaits antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , anti-fibrotic , and protective propertiesagainst myocyte loss. Thus , we aimed to evaluate the water-soluble form ofvitamin E efficacy in repairing anal sphincter muscle defects in rabbits.METHODS: Twenty-one male rabbits were equally assigned to the intact (without anyintervention) , control (sphincterotomy) , and Trolox (sphincterotomy + Troloxadministration) groups. Ninety days after sphincterotomy , the resting and squeezepressures were evaluated by manometry , and the number of motor units in thesphincterotomy site was calculated by electromyography. Also , the amount ofmuscle and collagen in the injury site was investigated by Mallory's trichromestaining. RESULTS: Ninety days after the intervention , the resting and squeezepressures in the intact and Trolox groups were significantly higher than in thecontrol group (P = 0.001). Moreover , the total collagen percentage of thesphincterotomy site was significantly lower in the Trolox group than in thecontrol group (P = 0.002) , and the total muscle percentage was significantlyhigher in the Trolox group compared to the control group (P = 0.001). Also , themotor unit number was higher in the Trolox group than in the control group(P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Trolox administration in the rabbit sphincterotomy modelcan decrease the amount of collagen and increase muscle , leading to improved analsphincter electromyography and manometry results. Therefore , Trolox is apotential treatment strategy for FI.

AB  - Vitamin E (VE) , an important lipid-soluble antioxidant , has great influence ongrowth and maintenance in animal. The effects of VE supplemented diet on growthand feed usage in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was investigated in thisstudy. Three formulated diets containing VE (0 , 50 and 100 mg/kg) were fed toNile tilapia (3.56 ± 0.16 g) in glass aquaria maintaining three replicate groupsfor 56 days (8 weeks). Survival , growth performance including weight gain ,percent weight gain , and specific growth rate (WG , % WG , and SGR) , and feedutilization comprising protein efficiency ratio and feed conversion ratio (PERand FCR) were calculated. Hemato-biochemical indices including hemoglobin level(Hb) , white blood cell (WBC) , red blood cell (RBC) and glucose level wereanalyzed. In addition , muscle morphology was examined after completion of theexperiment. At the end of the trial , WG , %WG , SGR , FCR and PER increasedsignificantly which had dietary VE supplimentation. However , no distinct changeswere observed in Hb level , RBC count , WBC count and glucose level among thesedifferent dietary groups. Dietary VE treatments significantly upgraded the musclefiber diameter and lowered the intra-muscle gap. Moreover , quantity ofhyperplastic muscle fiber as well as nucleus also significantly enhanced by VE.Morphological structure of muscle characterized by a huge proportion ofhyperplastic muscle that may be supposed to contribute the enhanced growth ofNile tilapia receiving VE supplemented diet. Therefore these results suggestedthat VE incorporation into the feed can be effective to improve the feedefficiency and maximize the growth of O. niloticus.

TI  - Combining GWAS and TWAS to identify candidate causal genes for tocochromanollevels in maize grain.
LID - 10.1093/genetics/iyac091 [doi]
LID - iyac091
AB  - Tocochromanols (tocopherols and tocotrienols , collectively vitamin E) arelipid-soluble antioxidants important for both plant fitness and human health. Themain dietary sources of vitamin E are seed oils that often accumulate high levelsof tocopherol isoforms with lower vitamin E activity. The tocochromanolbiosynthetic pathway is conserved across plant species but an integrated view ofthe genes and mechanisms underlying natural variation of tocochromanol levels inseed of most cereal crops remains limited. To address this issue , we utilized thehigh mapping resolution of the maize Ames panel of ∼1,500 inbred lines scoredwith 12.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms to generate metabolomic (maturegrain tocochromanols) and transcriptomic (developing grain) data sets for geneticmapping. By combining results from genome- and transcriptome-wide associationstudies , we identified a total of 13 candidate causal gene loci , including 5 thathad not been previously associated with maize grain tocochromanols: 4biosynthetic genes (arodeH2 paralog , dxs1 , vte5 , and vte7) and a plastidS-adenosyl methionine transporter (samt1). Expression quantitative trait locus(eQTL) mapping of these 13 gene loci revealed that they are predominantlyregulated by cis-eQTL. Through a joint statistical analysis , we implicatedcis-acting variants as responsible for colocalized eQTL and GWAS associationsignals. Our multiomics approach provided increased statistical power and mappingresolution to enable a detailed characterization of the genetic and regulatoryarchitecture underlying tocochromanol accumulation in maize grain and providedinsights for ongoing biofortification efforts to breed and/or engineer vitamin Eand antioxidant levels in maize and other cereals.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the serum level of fat-soluble vitaminsA , D and E in clinically healthy lactating female camel (Camelus dromedarius) andsuckling calf > one-year-old during winter and summer seasons in five mainregions of Saudi Arabia. 60 sera samples were collected and tested for vitaminsA , D and E levels and the results were statistically analyzed. The statisticalmean value of vitamin A was within the reported range but for D and E , there wereminor variations. The effect of season was insignificant (p > 0.05) for vitaminsA and E in the combined results of the dam and newborn together. This seasonaleffect was highly significant in dam serum (p < 0.05). Region effect wassignificant for vitamin A in the northern area (p < 0.05) and for vitamin E inthe southern region (p < 0.05). Correlations analysis revealed significantresults in the season vs vitamin A and E p < 0.05. Mean values of vitamins A , Dand E in dam and newborn did not observe significant variations however , in theseason and regions there were significant variations which can be attributed tothe climate difference , availability of balanced rations and camel management ineach location of the five main regions of Saudi Arabia. There is a great need forfurther studies and the consequent development of supplementation programs andcamel feed manufacturers awareness of such results is highly recommended.

TI  - Antioxidant Properties and Proximate Composition of Different Tissues of EuropeanBeaver.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27248973 [doi]
LID - 8973
AB  - The chemical composition , content of cholesterol , retinol and α-tocopherol , andthe total antioxidant capacity of different tissues from wild beavers wereinvestigated. The total phenolic contents and free radical scavenging activity(DPPH and ABTS assays) were analysed spectrophotometrically , and fat-solublevitamins were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The typeof tissue (skeletal muscle from loin and hind leg vs. adipose tissue fromsubcutaneous fat and tail) significantly affected content of all chemicalcomponents. The concentration of cholesterol was not related to total fatcontent. The retinol and α-tocopherol contents (µg/100 g) were significantlyhigher in the tail (13.0 and 391.2) and subcutaneous fat (12.2 and 371.3)compared to skeletal muscles (as an average 9.1 and 361.4). Among all tissues thetail showed significantly the highest values of DPPH (3.07 mM TE/100 g) , ABTS(3.33 mM TE/100 g) , and total phenolics (TPC , 543.7 mg GAE/100 g). Theconcentration of retinol was positively correlated with α-tocopherol (0.748 , p <0.001) , and both vitamins were very strongly correlated with DPPH (0.858 and0.886 , p < 0.001) , ABTS (0.894 and 0.851 , p < 0.001) , and TPC (0.666 and 0.913 , p< 0.001). The principal component analysis proved that moisture , ash , and proteincontents were representative for skeletal muscles , whereas , retinol ,α-tocopherol , ABTS and DPPH accurately described the antioxidant capacity oftissue from the tail.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Optimizing dietary intake during pregnancy and lactation is crucialto the growth and development of children and their lifelong health. We performeda systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the nutrient intakes ofpregnant and lactating women in Indonesia and Malaysia , countries that areexperiencing rapid nutrition transition in Southeast Asia. METHODS: We screened2,258 studies published between January 1980 and March 2021. The nutrient intakesof pregnant and lactating women were quantitatively analyzed to calculate thepercentage of adequacy using national recommended daily allowances or nutrientintakes (RDA/RNI) and estimated average requirements (EAR) for micronutrients.Standardized mean differences (SMD) between dietary intake and RDA/RNI weredetermined for selected nutrients. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were included andshowed that energy and macronutrient intakes among pregnant and lactating womenin both countries were below the RDA/RNI. In addition , most studies reported thatwomen failed to meet the EAR for vitamin D (<70% EAR) , vitamin E (<50% EAR) , andwater-soluble vitamins (<80% EAR) except for vitamin C and A among Malaysians.Moreover , calcium , potassium , and iron intakes of pregnant women were <60% EAR inIndonesia and <80% EAR in Malaysia. Phosphorus intake among pregnant women inboth countries and sodium intake among Malaysian pregnant women exceeded 100%EAR. Indonesian lactating women had <60% EAR for calcium and potassium intakes ,while Malaysian women had more than 100% EAR. For 21 studies reporting overallprotein intakes , the standard mean difference (SMD) was -2.26 (95% CI; -2.98 ,-1.54) below the RDA/RNI for pregnant women and -0.67 SMD (95% CI -15.7 , -11.5)for lactating women. When the four studies from Malaysia were analyzedseparately , protein intakes of pregnant women were above the RNI. Moreover , lowintakes of vitamin D , vitamin C , calcium , and iron , but sufficient intakes invitamin A , zinc , and phosphorus were observed in pregnant women in bothcountries. CONCLUSION: Dietary intakes of energy , macronutrients , andmicronutrients (vitamin D , vitamin E , water-soluble vitamins , calcium , and iron)of pregnant and lactating women in Indonesia and Malaysia were below therecommendations. Important heterogeneities were observed even between these twocountries for specific essential nutrient intakes. Innovative research andtargeted programs to address specific deficiencies should be prioritized.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021252204 ,identifier: CRD42021252204.

AB  - The immune and antioxidant systems are intimately connected and their role in theetiology of major psychiatric disorders is currently under study. The aim of thisstudy was to evaluate the potential associations between inflammatory/antioxidantperipheral markers and presence of psychotic symptoms or severity of illness inpatients affected by major psychiatric disorders. One hundred and twenty-sixdrug-free patients were included. A blood sample was collected to measuretotal/B/T lymphocytes and plasma levels of albumin , total bilirubin , uric acid ,C-reactive protein , and vitamins A and E. Severity of illness was assessed usingpsychometric scales. Groups of patients divided according to diagnosis werecompared in terms of measured markers using multivariate analyses of variance(MANOVAs). Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to investigatethe potential association between markers and severity of illness orpresence/absence of psychotic symptoms. Albumin plasma levels were higher inpatients with substance-induced psychotic disorder (SIPD) than subjects affectedby schizophrenia (F ​= ​4.923; p ​= ​0.003). Lower vitamin E (OR ​= ​0.81;p ​= ​0.014) and T lymphocyte (OR ​= ​0.99; p ​= ​0.048) plasma levels werepredictive of lifetime psychotic symptoms. Lower vitamin A levels were associatedwith higher Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores (β ​= ​-24.26;p ​= ​0.029) , independent of diagnosis. Patients with SIPD may be less vulnerableto oxidative stress. The severity of depressive symptoms , inversely associatedwith vitamin A plasma levels , is likely to be modulated by the degree ofinflammation. Patients presenting with lifetime psychotic symptoms may be morevulnerable to oxidative stress and may have a higher activation of humoralimmunity.

AB  - The synthesis of natural products 2-(2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid(1) and 2-(2,6-dibromo-3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid (2) and as well as theirderivatives 25 and 26 were carried out by substitution , hydrolysis anddemethylation reactions of the corresponding four benzyl bromides. Theantioxidant potentials of benzylic acid-derived bromophenols were , for the firsttime , appraised by several outstanding bioanalytical methods. Besides these , weestimated the antioxidant effects which were studied using the methods of DPPH· ,ABTS(•+) scavenging activities , ferric (Fe(3+)) and cupric (Cu(2+)) ions andFe(3+)-TPTZ reducing capacities. Benzylic acid-derived bromophenols were found aseffective DPPH(•) , and ABTS(•+) scavengers. The potential antioxidant activitiesof bromophenol derivatives 1 , 2 and 17-28 were compared to standard antioxidantsincluding BHA , BHT , α-Tocopherol , and Trolox , which is a water-soluble analog ofvitamin E. We expect that this innovative work will direct future studiesexploring the antioxidant properties of food , medicinal , and industrialapplications.

TI  - Use of metabolic syndrome severity to assess treatment with vitamin E andpioglitazone for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
PG  - 249-256
LID - 10.1111/jgh.15131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) , which can lead to liverfailure , requires liver biopsies to follow and is difficult to treat. Our goalwas to assess metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity as a predictor of treatmentsuccess and a marker of response. METHODS: We assessed data from thePioglitazone , Vitamin E , or Placebo for NASH Study , in which individuals withbiopsy-confirmed NASH were randomized to receive pioglitazone , vitamin E , orplacebo for 96 weeks. We assessed associations of a sex-specific andrace/ethnicity-specific MetS severity Z-score (MetS-Z) at baseline and 48 weekswith biopsy-determined endpoint of NASH resolution at 96 weeks. RESULTS: BaselineMetS-Z was inversely associated with odds of NASH resolution (odds ratio [OR] per1 SD of MetS-Z: 0.47 , 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 , 0.79). Decrease inMetS-Z during initial 48-week intervention was greatest for pioglitazonetreatment (effect size: -0.31 , 95% CI -0.15 , -0.48) and for vitamin E tendedtoward being greater for those with versus without NASH resolution (-0.18 vs-0.05). Overall , 48-week change in MetS-Z was associated with NASH resolution (ORper 1-SD change: 0.53 , 95% CI 0.33 , 0.85) , although this was attenuated in modelsthat included transaminases , which remained linked to treatment success (OR bychange-in-aspartate aminotransferase Z-score: 0.38 , 95% CI 0.19 , 0.76).CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with more severe metabolic derangement at baseline wereless likely to exhibit NASH resolution , suggesting that individuals may have athreshold of MetS severity beyond which successful treatment is unlikely. As anintegrated marker of metabolic abnormalities , MetS-Z was correlated withsuccessful treatment , although transaminases were a more consistent marker ofNASH resolution.

AB  - Aging is an independent risk factor for the development of various diseasesassociated , among others , with detrimental blood levels of fat- and water-solublevitamins. Thus , the objective of this study is to investigate age-related changesin blood levels of vitamin A , B12 , C , D , and E. Subject serum vitamin levels wereobtained from the combined National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys(NHANES). NHANESIII and NHANES 1999-2000 , 2001-2002 , 2003-2004 , and 2005-2006.The raw data set was stratified into five age groups G1- G5: 20 ≤ G1 < 30 , 30 ≤G2 < 40 , 40 ≤ G3 < 50 , 50 ≤ G4 < 60 , and 60 ≤ G5 < 70 years of age. Agestratified data was cleaned using the modified Horn algorithm. The referencerange for the vitamin level of a specific age group was defined as data betweenthe first and third quartile of the subject defined by normal blood pressure andnormal bone density. Age-dependent changes in serum/plasma vitamin levels wereassessed using the bootstrap technique with 10,000 repeats and Bonferroniadjustment. There was a continuous increase in vitamin A , B12 , D , and E levels inthe blood. However , the vitamin C concentration remained virtually constant inall age groups. There was a lack of cross-correlations between lipid andwater-soluble vitamin levels and blood pressure and bone health. The followingreference levels for vitamin A , B12 , C , D , and E in subjects older than 20 yearsof age were established: vitamin A: 1.32-2.8 mmol/L , vitamin B12: 257.94-498.33pmol/L , vitamin C: 38.18-79.2 mmol/L , vitamin D: 76.33-199.36 nmol/L and vitaminE: 3.65-41.12 μmol/L.

TI  - Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The Overlooked Complication of Type 2 Diabetes.
BTI - Endotext
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication of obesity andtype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most times it is an unrecognized comorbidity tothe primary care provider and endocrinologist. Today it is the most commonchronic liver disease in developed countries. It is characterized by insulinresistance and hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the absence of co-existingetiologies , such as excessive alcohol consumption , viral hepatitis , medicationsor other etiologies for hepatic steatosis. Its more severe form of the diseasewith steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hepatocyte injury (necrosis andinflammation) and frequently with fibrosis. Although it appears to be an indolentcondition , with few symptoms and often normal plasma aminotransferases , NASH is aleading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) , andsignificantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) andT2DM. The pathogenesis of NASH remains poorly understood , and likely to bemultifactorial , but insulin-resistant adipose tissue plays an important role. Thenatural history of NAFLD is incompletely understood , but risk factors for diseaseprogression include weight gain , obesity and T2DM , as well as the severity offibrosis stage at diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithms are evolving but we offer anapproach that integrates for the non-hepatologist plasma biomarkers , imaging , andthe role of liver biopsy for the management of these complex patients. At thepresent time , early screening -with biomarker panels or a liver ultrasound ,ideally with transient elastography- is reserved for high-risk patients (i.e. ,obese patients with T2DM or elevated plasma AST/ALT levels or evidence ofsteatosis at a random liver exam) until more accurate non-invasive methods areavailable. A liver biopsy should be considered on a case-by-case basis , toidentify those at risk of NASH-cirrhosis , working in close collaboration with ahepatologist. Treatment should include a comprehensive approach with lifestylemodification and therapeutic agents tested in RCTs , such as vitamin E (inpatients without diabetes) or pioglitazone for patients with or without diabetes.Pioglitazone , given its low-cost as a generic medication , long-standing trackrecord of efficacy in NASH , and cardiometabolic benefits , is likely to be forNASH what metformin has become for the management of T2DM. However , properpatient selection and close monitoring is needed. In addition , a number of newpharmacological agents are being studied in phase II/III trials and futuremanagement will involve the use of combination therapy , as for other chronicmetabolic conditions. In summary , endocrinologists need to be aware of the severemetabolic and liver-specific complications of NASH and establish early-on along-term management plan. Screening will likely take place in the same way asfor diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. A better understanding of its naturalhistory and pathogenesis of NASH , combined with improved diagnostic and treatmentoptions , will likely place endocrinologists at the forefront of the managementefforts to prevent end-stage liver disease in patients with NASH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As an antioxidant , vitamin E (VitE) may benefit the erythrocytes byprotecting glutathione from oxidation by free radicals and peroxide-generatingprocesses. METHODS: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for SystematicReviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines when reporting this systematicreview. We searched 6 electronic databases (PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , andCochrane Library) until May 8 , 2022. We included all relevant studies. Accordingto the study design , the Cochrane assessment tool (Risk of Bias 2) , Risk Of BiasIn Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions checklists , and National Institutesof Health tools were used to assess the risk of bias.Continuous data were pooledas a mean difference (MD) with a relative 95% confidence interval. The protocolwas registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022333848). RESULTS: Six studies were includedin the meta-analysis with a total of 181 patients. Compared with the controlgroup , VitE significantly improved the hemoglobin level for chronic hemolysis (MD= 2.72 g/dL , P < .0001) and for acute hemolysis (MD = 1.18 g/dL , P < .0001). Italso decreased the reticulocyte level for chronic hemolysis (MD = -1.39 P <.0001) and for acute hemolysis (MD = -1.42% , P < .0001). For before and afterstudies , the use of VitE significantly improved the level of packed cell volume(MD = 0.56% , P < .00001) , red blood cell half-life (MD = 2.19 days , P < .0001) ,and decreased the reticulocytes level (MD = -1.41% , P < .00001). CONCLUSION:Among patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , VitE mightprovide benefits such as increasing the hemoglobin , packed cell volume levels ,red blood cell half-life , and decreasing the reticulocyte level , so reducinghemolysis. Further high-quality , well-designed randomized controlled trials arerecommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antioxidant therapy is a promising treatment option for non-alcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD) after failure of lifestyle modification. We aimed toexplore the efficacy of combined vitamin E and C therapy compared to no treatmentfor NAFLD. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Ovid Embase , OvidMedline , PubMed , Cochrane Library , Scopus , and Web of Science from inception to28th April 2020. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted onrandomized controlled trials that assessed vitamin E and C co-treatment in NAFLD.Quality of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations ,Assessment , Development , and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Assessed outcomes werechanges in imaging findings , histological features , and serum transaminases.Subgroup analyses that compared adult versus children were further explored.RESULTS: Four studies (n=260) satisfied our eligibility criteria. Vitaminco-treatment  did not improve ultrasonographic liver brightness , histologicalparameters of hepatocyte injury (steatosis , lobular inflammation , andballooning) , fibrosis grading (standardized mean difference [SMD ]: 0.02 , 95% CI:-0.40 to 0.45 , I2=13%) , serum aspartate transaminase (mean difference [MD]:-0.05 , 95% CI: -2.59 to 2.50 , I2=0%) , and serum alanine transaminase (MD: 2.82 ,95% CI: -2.11 to 7.76 , I2=57%). Subgroup stratifications illustrated similarfindings. CONCLUSION: Vitamin co-treatment may have limited efficacy in NAFLD.However , we have little confidence in our effect estimates due to bias and othermajor constraints.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Plasma concentrations of bilirubin , a product of hemecatabolism formed by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) , inversely associate with therisk of metabolic diseases including hepatic steatosis and diabetes mellitus inhumans. Bilirubin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and may alsoregulate insulin signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha(PPARα) activity. However , a causal link between bilirubin and metabolic diseasesremains to be established. Here , we used the global Bvra gene knockout(Bvra(-/-)) mouse as a model of deficiency in bilirubin to assess its role inmetabolic diseases. APPROACH & RESULTS: We fed mice fat-rich diets to inducehepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Bile pigments were measured byLC-MS/MS , and hepatic lipids by LC-MS/MS (non-targeted lipidomics) , HPLC-UV andOil-Red-O staining. Oxidative stress was evaluated measuring F(2)-isoprostanes byGC-MS. Glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were verified by glucose andinsulin tolerance tests , ex vivo and in vivo glucose uptake , and Western blottingfor insulin signaling. Compared with wild type littermates , Bvra(-/-) micecontained negligible bilirubin in plasma and liver , and they had comparableglucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However , Bvra(-/-) mice exhibited aninflamed and fatty liver phenotype , accompanied by hepatic accumulation ofoxidized triacylglycerols and F(2)-isoprostanes , in association with depletion ofα-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol supplementation reversed the hepatic phenotype andobserved biochemical changes in Bvra(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggeststhat BVRA deficiency renders mice susceptible to oxidative stress-induced hepaticsteatosis in the absence of insulin resistance.

TI  - Ultrabright Green-Emitting Nanoemulsions Based on Natural Lipids-BODIPYConjugates.
LID - 10.3390/nano11030826 [doi]
LID - 826
AB  - Nanoemulsions (NEs) are water-dispersed oil droplets that constitute stealthbiocompatible nanomaterials. NEs can reach an impressive degree of fluorescentbrightness owing to their oily core that can encapsulate a large number offluorophores on the condition the latter are sufficiently hydrophobic andoil-soluble. BODIPYs are among the brightest green emitting fluorophores and asneutral molecules possess high lipophilicity. Herein , we synthesized threedifferent natural lipid-BODIPY conjugates by esterification of an acidic BODIPYby natural lipids , namely: α-tocopherol (vitamin E) , cholesterol , and stearylalcohol. The new BODIPY conjugates were characterized in solvents and oils beforebeing encapsulated in NEs at various concentrations. The physical (size ,stability over time , leakage) and photophysical properties (absorption andemission wavelength , brightness , photostability) are reported and showed that thenature of the lipid anchor and the nature of the oil used for emulsificationgreatly influence the properties of the bright NEs.

TI  - Effects of functional nutrients on chicken intestinal epithelial cells inducedwith oxidative stress.
PG  - 1040-1052
LID - 10.5187/jast.2023.e22 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects offunctional nutrients including various functional amino acids , vitamins , andminerals on chicken intestinal epithelial cells (cIECs) treated with oxidativestress. The cIECs were isolated from specific pathogen free eggs. Cells wereexposed to 0 mM supplement (control) , 20 mM threonine (Thr) , 0.4 mM tryptophan(Trp) , 1 mM glycine (Gly) , 10 μM vitamin C (VC) , 40 μM vitamin E (VE) , 5 μMvitamin A (VA) , 34 μM chromium (Cr) , 0.42 μM selenium (Se) , and 50 μM zinc (Zn)for 24 h with 6 replicates for each treatment. After 24 h , cells were furtherincubated with fresh culture medium (positive control , PC) or 1 mM H(2)O(2) withdifferent supplements (negative control , NC and each treatment). Oxidative stresswas measured by cell proliferation , whereas tight junction barrier function wasanalyzed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran permeability andtransepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Results indicated that cellviability and TEER values were less (p < 0.05) in NC treatments with oxidativestress than in PC treatments. In addition , FITC-dextran values were greater (p <0.05) in NC treatments with oxidative stress than in PC treatments. Thesupplementations of Thr , Trp , Gly , VC , and VE in cells treated with H(2)O(2)showed greater (p < 0.05) cell viability than the supplementation of VA , Cr , Se ,and Zn. The supplementations of Trp , Gly , VC , and Se in cells treated withH(2)O(2) showed the least (p < 0.05) cellular permeability. In addition , thesupplementation of Thr , VE , VA , Cr , and Zn in cells treated with H(2)O(2)decreased (p < 0.05) cellular permeability. At 48 h , the supplementations of Thr ,Trp , and Gly in cells treated with H(2)O(2) showed the greatest (p < 0.05) TEERvalues among all treatments , and the supplementations of VC and VE in cellstreated with H(2)O(2) showed greater (p < 0.05) TEER values than thesupplementations of VA , Cr , Se , and Zn in cells treated with H(2)O(2). Inconclusion , Thr , Trp , Gly , and VC supplements were effective in improving cellviability and intestinal barrier function of cIECs exposed to oxidative stress.

AB  - Phytotherapy has been promoted for the treatment of liver diseases in dogs. Theinterest in identifying the antioxidant/hepatoprotective potential of variousplants is increasing. Every 10 days for 30 days , forty dogs were subjected toblood sampling and hepatic ultrasound assessment. Clinically healthy dogs (groupA) and dogs with liver enzyme and ultrasound hepatic aspects and sizes outsidethe physiological range (group B) were divided into two subgroups. Every day for30 days , one subgroup received Epacare pet + pasta(®) and the other received aplacebo. Differences due to groups were observed in dROM , SHp , AST and LDH serumconcentrations. The administration of Epacarepet + pasta(®) for 30 days had aninfluence on the serum concentration of dROMs , SHp , AST , ALT , ALP , LDH , and urea.The application of paired Student's t-test showed a decrease in the longitudinaland transverse liver axis size. In conclusion , feed supplementation with Epacarepet + pasta(®) had a beneficial effect on the antioxidant status and liverenzymes in animals with liver enzymatic alterations and in healthy dogs.

AB  - Moringa oleifera and strawberry are cultivated extensively worldwide and aredivinely blessed with an enormous amount of nutritional and medicinalconstituents , such as vitamin C , vitamin E , iron , potassium , and phenolicantioxidants that play a pivotal role in treating , confining , and preventingdiabetes and many kinds of cancer. The focus of the study is to develop differentsamples of highly acceptable ready to serve (RTS) Moringa strawberry juice blendby underutilizing Moringa and strawberry juice in different proportions. Moringaoleifera's bitter taste and green color steeply limits its acceptability andcounter this drawback utilized with strawberry juice. The physicochemicalanalysis of blended juice was performed to investigate the suitability andkeeping quality of the juice mixture. The collected data signify that pHtitratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS) the slight modificationafter the inclusion of Moringa juice extract and throughout the storage. TheMoringa treatment positively improved the total phenolic content (TPC) ,antioxidant , and vitamin C from 12 to 49.17 mg GAE/100g , 61.41 to 87.69% , and64.03 to 86.65 mg/100 mL , respectively , but there was a slight decline inantioxidant quantity while stored under refrigerated conditions for one month. Anassimilative trend was noticed in TPC and vitamin C , which collapsed from49.17-36.32 mg GAE to 86.65-79.19 mg , respectively. In accordance with sensoryanalysis T (2) (90% strawberry juice and 10% Moringa extract) , the juice blendwas rated best in context to flavor , color , and taste. This juice blend proved tobe greatly effective especially for children suffering from malnutrition as wellas women to counter with its appreciable number of nutritional constituents.

TI  - Biochemical , Histological , and Ultrastructural Studies of the Protective Role ofVitamin E on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Male Rats.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11020390 [doi]
LID - 390
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclophosphamide (CP) (Cytoxan or Endoxan) is an efficient anti-tumoragent , widely used for the treatment of various neoplastic diseases. The studyaimed to investigate the protective role of vitamin E (vit E) in improvingcardiotoxicity in rats induced by CP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male Wistarrats were divided randomly into four experimental groups (each consisting of tenrats); the control group was treated with saline. The other three groups weretreated with vit E , CP , and the combination of vit E and CP. Serum lipidprofiles , enzyme cardiac biomarkers , and cardiac tissue antioxidants wereevaluated , as well as histological and ultrastructure investigations. RESULTS:CP-treated rats showed a significant increase in serum levels of cardiac markers(troponin , CK , LDH , AST , and ALT) , lipid profiles , a reduction in the antioxidantenzyme activities (CAT , SOD , and GPx) , and an elevation in the level of lipidperoxidation (LPO). The increase in the levels of troponin , LDH , AST , ALP , andtriglycerides is a predominant indicator of cardiac damage due to the toxiceffect of CP. The biochemical changes parallel cardiac injuries such asmyocardial infarction , myocarditis , and heart failure. Vitamin E played a pivotalrole , as it attenuated most of these changes because of its ability to scavengefree radicals and reduce LPO. In addition , vit E was found to improve thehistopathological alterations caused by CP where no evidence of damage wasobserved in the cardiac architecture , and the cardiac fibers had regained theirnormal structure with minimal hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of itsantioxidant activity and its stabilizing impact on the cardiomyocyte membranes ,vit E is recommended as a potential candidate in decreasing the damaging effectsof CP.

TI  - Vitamin E absorption and kinetics in healthy women , as modulated by food and byfat , studied using 2 deuterium-labeled α-tocopherols in a 3-phase crossoverdesign.
PG  - 1148-1167
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqz172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the human vitamin E [α-tocopherol (α-T)] requirement isdifficult , and novel approaches to assess α-T absorption and trafficking areneeded. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the dual-isotope technique , using 2deuterium-labeled [intravenous (IV) d6- and oral d3-] α-T , would be effective indetermining α-T fractional absorption. Further , defined liquid meal (DLM) fat orfasting would modulate α-T fractional absorption and lipoprotein transport.METHODS: A 3-phase cr ossover design was used. At 0 h , participants received IVd6-α-T and consumed d3-α-T with a 600-kcal DLM (40% or 0% fat) followed bycontrolled meals or by the 0% fat DLM , a 12-h fast , and then controlled meals.Blood samples and fecal samples were collected at intervals and analyzed byLC-MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from plasma tracerconcentrations and enrichments. Fractional absorption was calculated from d3- tod6-α-T areas under the curve , from a novel mathematical model , and from thebalance method (oral d3-α-T minus fecal d3-α-T excreted). RESULTS: Estimated α-Tfractional absorption during the 40% fat intervention was 55% ± 3% (mean ± SEM;n = 10) , which was 9% less than during the 0% fat intervention (64% ± 3% , n = 10;P < 0.02). Fasting had no apparent effect (56% ± 3% , n = 7) , except it slowedplasma oral d3-α-T appearance. Both balance data and model outcomes confirmedthat the DLM fat did not potentiate d3-α-T absorption. During the IV emulsionclearance , HDL rapidly acquired d6-α-T (21 ± 2 nmol/L plasma per minute). Duringthe first 8 h postdosing , triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) werepreferentially d3-α-T enriched relative to LDL or HDL , showing the TRL precursorrole. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitatively , α-T absorption is not limited by fat absenceor by fasting. However , α-T leaves the intestine by a process that is prolongedduring fasting and potentiated by eating , suggesting that α-T absorption ishighly dependent on chylomicron assembly processes. This trial was registered atclinicaltrials.gov as NCT00862433.

TI  - Cytokine storm in aged people with CoV-2: possible role of vitamins as therapy orpreventive strategy.
PG  - 2115-2131
LID - 10.1007/s40520-020-01669-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019 , a novel human-infecting coronavirus , SARS-CoV-2 ,had emerged. The WHO has classified the epidemic as a "public health emergency ofinternational concern". A dramatic situation has unfolded with thousands ofdeaths , occurring mainly in the aged and very ill people. Epidemiological studiessuggest that immune system function is impaired in elderly individuals and thesesubjects often present a deficiency in fat-soluble and hydrosoluble vitamins.METHODS: We searched for reviews describing the characteristics of autoimmunediseases and the available therapeutic protocols for their treatment. We set themas a paradigm with the purpose to uncover common pathogenetic mechanisms betweenthese pathological conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore , we searchedfor studies describing the possible efficacy of vitamins A , D , E , and C inimproving the immune system function. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection inducesstrong immune system dysfunction characterized by the development of an intenseproinflammatory response in the host , and the development of a life-threateningcondition defined as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This leads to acuterespiratory syndrome (ARDS) , mainly in aged people. High mortality and lethalityrates have been observed in elderly subjects with CoV-2-related infection.CONCLUSIONS: Vitamins may shift the proinflammatory Th17-mediated immune responsearising in autoimmune diseases towards a T-cell regulatory phenotype. This reviewdiscusses the possible activity of vitamins A , D , E , and C in restoring normalantiviral immune system function and the potential therapeutic role of thesemicronutrients as part of a therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Gemcitabine-Vitamin E Prodrug-Loaded Micelles for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16010095 [doi]
LID - 95
AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive cancer subtype presenting unmet clinicalchallenges. Conventional chemotherapy , which includes antimetabolite gemcitabine(GEM) , is seriously undermined by a short half-life , its lack of targetingability , and systemic toxicity. GEM incorporation in self-assembled nanosystemsis still underexplored due to GEM's hydrophilicity which hinders efficientencapsulation. We hypothesized that vitamin E succinate-GEM prodrug (VES-GEMconjugate) combines hydrophobicity and multifunctionalities that can facilitatethe development of Pluronic(®) F68 and Pluronic(®) F127 micelle-basednanocarriers , improving the therapeutic potential of GEM. Pluronic(®) F68/VES-GEMand Pluronic(®) F127/VES-GEM micelles covering a wide range of molar ratios wereprepared by solvent evaporation applying different purification methods , andcharacterized regarding size , charge , polydispersity index , morphology , andencapsulation. Moreover , the effect of sonication and ultrasonication and theinfluence of a co-surfactant were explored together with drug release , stability ,blood compatibility , efficacy against tumour cells , and cell uptake. The VES-GEMconjugate-loaded micelles showed acceptable size and high encapsulationefficiency (>95%) following an excipient reduction rationale. Pluronic(®)F127/VES-GEM micelles evidenced a superior VES-GEM release profile (cumulativerelease > 50% , pH = 7.4) , stability , cell growth inhibition (<50% cell viabilityfor 100 µM VES-GEM) , blood compatibility , and extensive cell internalization , andtherefore represent a promising approach to leveraging the efficacy and safety ofGEM for PC-targeted therapies.

TI  - Vitamin E TPGS-Poloxamer Nanoparticles Entrapping a Novel PI3Kα InhibitorPotentiate Its Activity against Breast Cancer Cell Lines.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14091977 [doi]
LID - 1977
AB  - N-(2-fluorphenyl)-6-chloro-4-hydroxy-2-quinolone-3-carboxamide (R19) is a newlysynthesized phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PI3Kα) inhibitor with promisingactivity against cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to develop apolymeric nanoparticle (NP) formulation for R19 to address its poor aqueoussolubility and to facilitate its future administration in preclinical andclinical settings. NPs were prepared by nanoprecipitation using two polymers:D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS) and thepoloxamer Pluronic P123 in different ratios. Physicochemical characterization ofthe NPs revealed them to be around 100 nm in size with high monodispersity , aspherical morphology , and an almost neutral surface charge. The NPs achieved ~60%drug loading efficiency and sustained release of R19 for up to 96 h , withexcellent colloidal stability in serum-containing cell culture media. NPscontaining TPGS enhanced R19's potency against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancercells in vitro , with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) rangingbetween 1.8 and 4.3 µM compared to free R19 , which had an IC(50) of 14.7-17.0 µM.The NPs also demonstrated low cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts andmore significant induction of apoptosis compared to the free drug , which wascorrelated with their cellular uptake efficiency. Our findings present abiocompatible NP formulation for the delivery of a cancer-targeted PI3Kαinhibitor , R19 , which can further enhance its potency for the treatment of breastcancer and potentially other cancer types.

TI  - Antioxidant Therapy as an Effective Strategy against Noise-Induced Hearing Loss:From Experimental Models to Clinic.
LID - 10.3390/life13041035 [doi]
LID - 1035
AB  - Cochlear redox unbalance is the main mechanism of damage involved in thepathogenesis of noise-induced-hearing loss. Indeed , the increased free radicalproduction , in conjunction with a reduced efficacy of the endogenous antioxidantsystem , plays a key role in cochlear damage induced by noise exposure. For thisreason , several studies focused on the possibility to use exogenous antioxidantto prevent or attenuate noise-induce injury. Thus , several antioxidant molecules ,alone or in combination with other compounds , have been tested in bothexperimental and clinical settings. In our findings , we tested the protectiveeffects of several antioxidant enzymes , spanning from organic compounds tonatural compounds , such as nutraceuticals of polyphenols. In this review , wesummarize and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of antioxidant supplementationfocusing on polyphenols , Q-Ter , the soluble form of CoQ10 , Vitamin E andN-acetil-cysteine , which showed great otoprotective effects in different animalmodels of noise induced hearing loss and which has been proposed in clinicaltrials.

TI  - Diet , exercise , and supplements: what is their role in the management of themetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children?
PG  - 988-1006
LID - 10.1007/s12020-024-03783-7 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) , previouslyknown as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) , is the main cause of chronicliver disease in children and adolescents. Indeed , epidemiological studies haveshown that MASLD affects up to 40% of children with obesity. Despite the recentapproval of medications that target weight loss in adolescents that could havebenefits on pediatric MASLD , lifestyle interventions , such as diet and exercise ,remain the mainstay of our therapeutic approach. More specifically , studies ondiet alone have focused on the possible role of carbohydrate or fat restriction ,albeit without a definite answer on the best approach. Weight loss after dietaryintervention in children with obesity and MASLD has a beneficial effect ,regardless of the diet used. In relation to the role of exercise in MASLDreversal , indirect evidence comes from studies showing that a sedentary lifestyleleading to poor fitness , and low muscle mass is associated with MASLD. However ,research on the direct effect of exercise on MASLD in children is scarce. Acombination of diet and exercise seems to be beneficial with several studiesshowing improvement in surrogate markers of MASLD , such as serum alanineaminotransferase and hepatic fat fraction , the latter evaluated with imagingstudies. Several dietary supplements , such as vitamin E , probiotics , and omega-3fatty acid supplements have also been studied in children and adolescents withMASLD , but with equivocal results. This review aims to critically presentavailable data on the effects of lifestyle interventions , including diet ,exercise , and dietary supplements , on pediatric MASLD , thus suggesting a framefor future research that could enhance our knowledge on pediatric MASLDmanagement and optimize clinicians' approach to this vexing medical condition.

AB  - The present study investigated the adverse effects of arsenic and chromium inbroilers and ascertained the role of vitamin E and bentonite in alleviating theirharmful effects. For this purpose , we experimented on 180 one-day-old broilerchickens. The feed was administered to broiler chicks of groups 2 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9chromium @ (270 mg.kg(-1) BW). Groups 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 were administered arsenic@ (50 mg.kg(-1) BW). Groups 4 , 7 , and 9 received vitamin E (150 mg.kg(-1) BW) ,and groups 5 , 8 , and 9 received bentonite (5%) , respectively. Group 1 was kept incontrol. All the broiler chicks treated with chromium and arsenic showed asignificant (p < 0.05) decline in erythrocytic parameters on experimental days 21and 42. Total proteins decreased significantly , while ALT , AST , urea , andcreatinine increased significantly (p < 0.05). TAC and CAT decreasedsignificantly (p < 0.05) , while TOC and MDA concentrations increasedsignificantly (p < 0.05) in chromium and arsenic-treated groups on experimentaldays 21 and 42. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong positivecorrelation between TAC and CAT (Pearson correlation value = 0.961; p < 0.001) ,similarly TOC and MDA positive correlation (Pearson correlation value = 0.920; p< 0.001). However , TAC and CAT showed a negative correlation between TOC and MDA.The intensity of gross and microscopic lesions was more in chromium (270mg.kg(-1)) and arsenic (50 mg.kg(-1)) singly or in combination-treated groups.Thus , broiler chicks treated with chromium plus arsenic exhibited higher grossand microscopic lesion intensity than other treated groups. Fatty degeneration ,severe cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration , and expansion of sinusoidal spaces werethe main lesions observed in the liver. Kidneys showed renal epithelial cellsnecrosis , glomerular shrinkage , and severe cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration.Co-administration of bentonite along with chromium and arsenic resulted inpartial amelioration (group 8) compared to groups 7 and 9 , administered arsenic +chromium + vitamin E and arsenic + chromium + vitamin E + bentonite ,respectively. It was concluded that arsenic and chromium cause damage not only tohaemato-biochemical parameters but also lead to oxidation stress in broilers.Vitamin E and bentonite administration can ameliorate toxicity and oxidativestress produced by arsenic and chromium.

AB  - Background Lycopene is a naturally occurring compound classified as a carotenoid ,a group of pigments responsible for the vibrant colors observed in many fruitsand vegetables. It is most commonly associated with red-colored fruits andvegetables , such as tomatoes , watermelon , pink grapefruit , and papaya. Vitamin Eencompasses a group of chemical compounds that share a structural relationshipwith alpha-tocopherol and are essential for the proper functioning of the humanbody. It is a fat-soluble vitamin and is known for its antioxidant properties.The aim of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of lycopeneextract , vitamin E extract , and their combination against oral pathogens fortheir potential application in the treatment of oral diseases. Materials andmethods The potential antimicrobial effects of extracts derived from lycopene ,vitamin E , and their combination were evaluated against oral commensals likeStaphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus mutans , Enterococcus faecalis , and Candidaalbicans. Three concentrations (25 μl , 50 μl , and 100 μl) of the extract weretested. Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and Rose Bengal agar (RBA) bases were utilizedto determine the zone of inhibition. And the experiments were repeated intriplicate for each group. Results The identification and assessment of theantimicrobial activity of lycopene extract , vitamin E extract , and theircombination revealed the greatest efficacy at the highest concentration (100 μl)against all tested microbial strains. Notably , C. albicans exhibited the highestsusceptibility compared to the other strains. Vitamin E had the leastantimicrobial effect and combination had the highest antimicrobial effect.Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated substantial antimicrobialactivity of lycopene and vitamin E. These findings suggest that lycopene andvitamin E can be harnessed in the development of diverse drug formulations forthe treatment of oral diseases.

TI  - Optimization of a Luteolin-Loaded TPGS/Poloxamer 407 Nanomicelle: The Effects ofCopolymers , Hydration Temperature and Duration , and Freezing Temperature onEncapsulation Efficiency , Particle Size , and Solubility.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15143741 [doi]
LID - 3741
AB  - BACKGROUND: Luteolin is a flavonoid compound that has been widely studied for itsvarious anti-cancer properties and sensitization to multidrug-resistant cells.However , the limited solubility and bioavailability of Lut hindered its potentialclinical use. Theoretically , the combination of this compound with vitamin E TPGSand poloxamer 407 can produce a synergistic effect to enhance tumor apoptosis andP-glycoprotein inhibition. This study aimed to develop and optimize vitamin ETPGS/Poloxamer 407 micelles loaded with luteolin through investigating certainfactors that can affect the encapsulation efficiency and particle size of themicelle. METHODS: A micelle was prepared using the film hydration method , and themicellar solution was lyophilized. The cake formed was analyzed. The factorsinvestigated include the concentrations of the surfactants , ratio of vitamin ETPGS/Poloxamer 407 , temperature of the hydrating solution , duration of hydration ,and freezing temperature before lyophilization. The effects of these factors onthe encapsulation efficiency and particle size of the micelle were also studied.The encapsulation efficiency was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer , whileparticle size was measured using dynamic light scattering. RESULTS: The optimizedmicelle was found to have 90% encapsulation efficiency with a particle size ofless than 40 nm , which was achieved using a 10% concentration of surfactants at avitamin E TPGS/Poloxamer 407 ratio of 3:1. The optimized temperature forhydrating the micellar film was 40 °C , the optimized mixing time was 1 h , and theoptimized freezing temperature was -80 °C. The solubility of the luteolin-loadedmicelles increased 459-fold compared to pure Lut in water. The critical micelleconcentration of the vitamin E TPGS/Poloxamer 407 micelle was 0.001 mg/mL , andthe release study showed that luteolin-loaded micelles exhibited sustainedrelease behavior. The release of luteolin from a micelle was found to be higherin pH 6.8 compared to pH 7.4 , which signified that luteolin could be accumulatedmore in a tumor microenvironment compared to blood. CONCLUSION: This studydemonstrated that several factors need to be considered when developing suchnanoparticles in order to obtain a well-optimized micelle.

AB  - Health specialists currently suggest low-cholesterol diets , suggesting thatcholesterol in the form of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) reduces the risk ofchronic atherosclerosis. The large volume of literature describes the biologicalroles of vitamin E and its application to preventing disease and improving thehealth and productive performances of farm animals. The present study aimed toevaluate the effects of vitamin E (Alpha-tocopherol acetate) supplementation andmelatonin implants on biochemical blood , lipid profile and muscle vitamin Econtent of Awassi male lambs fed by a high and normal diet in Iraq. The lambswere divided into teen groups as control normal energy diet T1 (NED) T2 (HED)concentrated lamb fattening feed. Two levels of melatonin (18 and 36 mg implant)were applied to T3 , T4 , T5 , and T6 treatment and 2 levels of Vitamin E(Alpha-tocopherol acetate) diet 200 mg/kg , 400 mg/kg to T7. T8. T9 and T10 ,respectively. Results from the present study indicate that Vitamin E 200 , 400mg/lamb/day and melatonin implantation 18 mg , 36 mg/lamb/day significantly(P<0.05) increased total protein in serum while decreasing globulin level ,glucose concentration in serum , melatonin implantation 36 mg/lamb and vitamin E400 mg/lamb/day recorded significantly (P<0.05). The same effect on decreasingcholesterol concentration in serum 42.6mg\dl , 40.5 mg\dl , respectively , comparedto non-treated groups. Vitamin E 200 mg/kg/lamb recorded the lowest AST level inserum , 43.3. Lambs implanted with Melatonin 36 mg/lamb and fed a high-energy diet(T8) resulted in a significant decrease of serum ALT activity (P<0.05) incomparison to other treated groups 12.7 U/L was achieved. Lambs fed a normalenergy diet with vitamin E 200 mg/kg/lamb (T4) exceeded other treated groups ,decreasing ALT serum levels by 9.35 U/L. Interestingly , muscle vitamin Econcentrations for lambs received 200 , 400 mg/lamb/day on the 2(nd) , 7(th) and14(th) days of the storage period , and fed high energy diet (T10) or normalenergy diet (T5) were significantly higher compared to control group (T1 , T6).

PG  - 67-74
AB  - Current study evaluated the synergistic potential of propolis and vitamin Eagainst sub-acute toxicity of aluminum chloride on different biochemicalparameters and liver histology. Swiss albino mice (n=42) were randomly dividedinto seven groups. Group I received 0.2 ml of 0.9 % saline solution , Group IIreceived Propolis (50 mg/kg b.w.) , Group III received vitamin E (150 mg/kg b.w.) ,Group IV received AlCl(3) 50 mg/kg b.w. , Group V received AlCl(3) + Propolis ,Group VI received AlCl(3) + vitamin E and Group VII received AlCl(3) + propolis +vitamin E. Blood and tissue samples were collected after 7 and 21 days. The bodyweight of the animals significantly increased in all groups except Group IV. Theconcentration of serum high density lipoprotein significantly decreased in GroupIV and increased in Group V , VI and VII. The level of aspartate aminotransferase ,alanine transferase , alkaline phosphatase , triglycerides , total cholesterol , andlow density lipoprotein significantly increased in AlCl(3) treated group andincreased in Group V , VI and VII. Tissue sections were processed and stained byhematoxylin and eosin. Group II showed cellular necrosis. Group V , VI showeddecreased number of vacuolization , sinusoidal spacing and macrophage cellinfiltration. Group VI showed less degenerative changes in the third week.Vitamin E and propolis in combination with Al provides more protection againstAlCl(3) induced toxicity.

TI  - Tocopherols and Tocotrienols Are Bioavailable in Rats and Primarily Excreted inFeces as the Intact Forms and 13'-Carboxychromanol Metabolites.
PG  - 222-230

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin E α- , γ- , or δ-tocopherol (αT , γT , δT) and γ- orδ-tocotrienol (γTE , δTE) are metabolized to hydroxychromanols andcarboxychromanols including 13'-carboxychromanol (13'-COOH) , 11'-COOH , andcarboxyethyl hydroxychroman (CEHC) , some of which have unique bioactivitiescompared with the vitamers. However , the bioavailability of these metabolites hasnot been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK)of vitamin E forms and metabolites in rats. METHODS: Six-week-old male Wistarrats received 1-time gavage of γT-rich tocopherols (50 mg/kg) containing γT/δT/αT(57.7% , 21.9% , and 10.9% , respectively) or δTE-rich tocotrienols (35 mg/kg)containing δTE/γTE (8:1). We quantified the time course of vitamin E forms andmetabolites in the plasma and their 24-h excretion to the urine and feces. Thegeneral linear model repeated measure was used for analyses of the PK data.RESULTS: In the rats' plasma , Cmax of γT or δTE was 25.6 ± 9.1 μM (Tmax = 4 h) or16.0 ± 2.3 μM (Tmax = 2 h) , respectively , and sulfated CEHCs and sulfated11'-COOHs were the predominant metabolites with Cmax of 0.4-0.5 μM (Tmax ∼5-7 h)or ∼0.3 μM (Tmax at 4.7 h) , respectively. In 24-h urine , 2.7% of γT and 0.7% ofδTE were excreted as conjugated CEHCs. In the feces , 17-45% of supplementedvitamers were excreted as unmetabolized forms and 4.9-9.2% as unconjugatedcarboxychromanols , among which 13'-COOHs constituted ∼50% of total metabolitesand the amount of δTE-derived 13'-COOHs was double that of 13'-COOH derived fromγT. CONCLUSIONS: PK data of vitamin E forms in rats reveal that γT , δT , γTE , andδTE are bioavailable in the plasma and are mainly excreted as unmetabolized formsand long-chain metabolites including 13'-COOHs in feces , with more metabolitesfrom tocotrienols than from tocopherols.

AB  - Malnutrition and sarcopenia commonly overlap and contribute to adverse healthoutcomes. Previously , chronic supplementation with two oral nutritionalsupplements (ONS) , control (C(ONS)) and experimental ONS enriched with protein ,vitamin D and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) (E(ONS)) , improved muscle strengthand quality in malnourished sarcopenic older adults , with E(ONS) demonstratingearly strength benefits at 12 weeks. To understand the underlying biologicalmechanisms contributing to the observed early strength benefits of E(ONS) , weexamined serum biomarker changes in response to 12-week supplementation. Serumsamples (E(ONS) (n = 90) and C(ONS) (n = 103)) collected at baseline and 12 weekswere analyzed. Biomarkers (n = 243) were measured using multiplexed immunoassay ,commercial immunoassays and ELISAs. Sixty markers were excluded with levels belowassay detection limits. Sixteen biomarkers significantly changed in response toboth interventions including nutritional and metabolic markers. Thirteenbiomarkers significantly changed in response to E(ONS) but not C(ONS). Increasesin immunoglobulins , myoglobin , total protein , vitamin E and magnesium wereobserved with E(ONS). Inflammation-related ferritin and osteopontin decreased ,while soluble receptors for cytokines increased , suggesting decreasedinflammation. Sex hormone-binding globulin associated with sarcopenia alsodecreased with E(ONS.) Biomarkers reflective of multiple biological systems wereimpacted by nutritional intervention in sarcopenic older adults. Incrementalbiomarker changes were observed in response to E(ONS) containing HMB thatpossibly link to improvements in skeletal muscle health.

AB  - Previously , we synthesized 4-(N)-docosahexaenoyl 2' , 2'-difluorodeoxycytidine(DHA-dFdC) , a novel lipophilic compound with a potent , broad-spectrum antitumoractivity. Herein , we report a solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) formulation ofDHA-dFdC with improved apparent aqueous solubility , chemical stability , as wellas efficacy in a mouse model. The SLNs were prepared from lecithin/glycerolmonostearate-in-water emulsions emulsified with D-α-tocopherol polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and Tween 20. The resultant DHA-dFdC-SLNs were102.2 ± 7.3 nm in diameter and increased the apparent solubility of DHA-dFdC inwater to at least 5.2 mg/mL , more than 200-fold higher than its intrinsic watersolubility. DHA-dFdC in a lyophilized powder of DHA-dFdC-SLNs was significantlymore stable than the waxy solid of pure DHA-dFdC. DHA-dFdC-SLNs also showed anincreased cytotoxicity against certain tumor cells than DHA-dFdC. The plasmaconcentration of DHA-dFdC in mice intravenously injected with DHA-dFdC-SLNs indispersion followed a bi-exponential model , with a half-life of ~44 h. In micebearing B16-F10 murine melanoma , DHA-dFdC-SLNs were significantly more effectivethan DHA-dFdC in controlling the tumor growth. In addition , histology evaluationrevealed a high level of apoptosis and tumor encapsulation in tumors in micetreated with DHA-dFdC-SLNs. DHA-dFdC-SLNs represents a new DHA-dFdC formulationwith improved antitumor activity.

TI  - Associations of Dietary Lipid-Soluble Micronutrients with Hepatic Steatosis amongAdults in the United States.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9091093 [doi]
LID - 1093
AB  - Lipid-soluble micronutrients may be beneficial to non-alcoholic fatty liverdisease due to their important roles in metabolism and maintaining tissuefunctions. Utilizing 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ,this study examined the potential overall and race/ethnicity-specific (black ,Hispanic and white) associations of dietary lipid-soluble micronutrients(α-tocopherol , retinol , vitamin D , β-carotene and total carotenoids) with hepaticsteatosis. The analysis included 4376 adults (1037 blacks , 981 Hispanics , 1549whites) aged ≥20 years who completed the transient elastography examination withdietary data available. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI)were estimated using logistic regressions. The age-adjusted prevalence ofsteatosis was 20.9% for blacks , 34.0% for Hispanics and 28.7% for whites.Overall , dietary α-tocopherol was inversely associated with steatosis (highestvs. lowest quartile: OR = 0.51 , 95%CI = 0.35-0.74 , P(trend) = 0.0003). Theassociations remained significant among blacks (highest vs. lowest tertile: OR =0.45 , 95%CI = 0.26-0.77 , P(trend) = 0.002) and whites (highest vs. lowesttertile: OR = 0.56 , 95%CI = 0.33-0.94 , P(trend) = 0.02). Higher α-tocopherolintake was associated with lower odds of steatosis among all (P(trend) = 0.016)and black participants (P(trend) = 0.003) classified as never/rare/occasionalalcohol drinkers. There was a trend suggesting higher β-carotene intake withlower odds of steatosis (P(trend) = 0.01). Our results suggest potentialprotective effects of dietary vitamin E as α-tocopherol on steatosis particularlyamong blacks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fat-soluble vitamins , including vitamins A , D and E , play animportant role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism , and may affectinfant birth weight. Evidence on the association of birthweight with fat-solublevitamins is controversial. Therefore , this study aims is to determine theassociations of birthweight with vitamin A , D , and E concentrations in cordblood. METHODS: A total of 199 mother-infant pairs were enrolled in the study.According to gestational age and birth weight , the mother-infant pairs weredivided into small for gestational age (SGA) , appropriate for gestational age(AGA) , and large for gestational age (LGA). The Vitamin A , D , and Econcentrations in serum were measured by high-performance liquid chromatographytandem-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The concentrations of vitamin A in the SGAgroup were significantly lower than those in the AGA and LGA groups. Theconcentrations of vitamin E in the SGA group were significantly higher than thosein the AGA and LGA groups. However , no significant differences were observed invitamin D among the three groups. Being male (β = 0.317 , p < 0.001) and birthweight (β = 0.229 , p = 0.014) were positively correlated with the levels ofvitamin A. Birth weight (β = -0.213 , p= 0.026) was correlated with lower levelsof vitamin E. No correlation was found between influencing Factors and the levelsof vitamin D (p> 0.05). After adjusting for gestational age , sex , mother's age ,delivery mode , pre-pregnancy BMI , and weight gain during pregnancy , the levels ofcord blood vitamin A were positively correlated with birth weight (p=0.012).CONCLUSION: The infant's birth weight is associated with the levels of cord bloodvitamins A and E. The dysregulation of vitamins A and E in infants may be a riskfactor for fetal growth and future metabolic diseases.

TI  - Protective effects of selenium on acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity andhepatotoxicity in rats.
PG  - 1041-1049
LID - 10.22038/ijbms.2021.55009.12331 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acrylamide (ACR) , has wide uses in different industries. ACR inducedseveral toxicities including neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. The probableprotective effects of selenium on ACR-induced neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity inrats were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were studied for 11days in 8 groups: 1. Control , 2. ACR (50 mg/kg , IP) , 3-5. ACR+ selenium (0.2 ,0.4 , 0.6 mg/kg , IP) , 6. ACR+ the most effective dose of selenium (0.6 mg/kg , IP)three days after ACR administration , 7. ACR+ vitamin E (200 mg/kg IP , every otherday) 8. Selenium (0.6 mg/kg IP). Finally , behavioral tests were done. The levelsof malondialdehyde (MDA) , glutathione (GSH) , Bcl-2 , Bax and caspase 3 proteins inliver and cerebral cortex tissues were measured. Also , the amount of albumin ,total protein , alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST)enzymes were determined in serum. RESULTS: ACR caused the severe motorimpairment , increased MDA level and decreased GSH content , enhanced Bax/Bcl-2ratio and caspase 3 proteins in brain and liver tissues. Besides , the level ofAST was elevated while the total serum protein and albumin levels were decreased.Administration of selenium (0.6 mg/kg) (from the first day of the experiment andthe third day) significantly recovered locomotor disorders , increased GSHcontent , and reduced MDA level. Also , selenium decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio andcaspase 3 levels in brain and liver tissues. CONCLUSION: The oxidative stress andapoptosis pathways have important roles in neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity ofACR. Selenium significantly reduced ACR-induced toxicity through inhibition ofoxidative stress and apoptosis.

TI  - Haptoglobin 2 Allele is Associated With Histologic Response to Vitamin E inSubjects With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.
PG  - 750-758
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000001142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin (Hp) genotype has been linked to oxidative stress andcardiovascular outcomes in response to vitamin E (VitE) among patients withdiabetes mellitus. Its effect on histologic response to VitE in nonalcoholicsteatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. GOALS: Our objective was to determine if Hpgenotype associates with response to VitE in patients with NASH. STUDY: A posthoc analysis of 228 patients receiving VitE or placebo in 2 clinical trials wasperformed. Regression analysis was used to assess the effect of VitE versusplacebo , by Hp genotype (1-1 , 2-1 , or 2-2) , on histologic features and laboratorymarkers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , comparing baseline to end oftreatment values. An interaction term was included in the regression models toassess differential treatment effect across Hp genotype. RESULTS: Hp 2-2 patientstreated with VitE versus placebo showed significant histologic improvement (51%vs. 20%; OR=4.2; P=0.006) , resolution of steatohepatitis (44% vs. 12%; OR=6.2;P=0.009) , decrease in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Activity Score (NAS) (-2.2vs. -0.6; P=0.001) , and decrease in liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase ,aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase , and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.Hp 2-1 patients on VitE versus placebo showed improved resolution ofsteatohepatitis , NAS and liver enzymes. Hp 1-1 patients showed no significantimprovement in histology or liver enzymes. VitE had no effect on fibrosis stagein any group. Regression analysis showed incremental benefit of having Hp 2-2 or2-1 versus 1-1 for all liver enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Hp 2 allele is associated withgreater histologic and biological improvement in NASH with VitE treatmentcompared with the Hp 1 allele.

TI  - The association between dietary micronutrient patterns and odds of diabeticnephropathy: A case-control study.
PG  - 3255-3265
LID - 10.1002/fsn3.3306 [doi]
AB  - Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to diabetic nephropathy (DN). The aim of the studywas to investigate the relationship between different dietary micronutrientpatterns and risk of DN in women. This was a case-control study. One hundred andfive patients had DN (defined as urinary mg of albumin per gram of creatinine≥30 mg/g) were chosen as the case and 105 women without DN were chosen ascontrol. Dietary intakes were assessed by a semi-quantitative food frequencyquestionnaire. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was used toderive the micronutrient patterns. Patterns were divided into two groups of lowerand higher than median. Logistic regression was used to discern and find the oddsratio (ORs) of DN , and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on themicronutrient patterns in crude and adjusted model. Three patterns which wereincluded , (1) mineral patterns such as chromium , manganese , biotin , vitamin B6 ,phosphorus , magnesium , selenium , copper , zinc , potassium , and iron , (2)water-soluble vitamin patterns such as vitamin B5 , B2 , folate , B1 , B3 , B12 ,sodium and C , and (3) fat-soluble vitamin patterns such as calcium , vitamin K ,beta carotene , alpha tocopherol , alpha carotene , vitamin E , and vitamin A , wereextracted. An inverse relationship was found between risk of DN and followingmineral patterns and fat-soluble vitamin patterns in adjusted model (ORs = 0.51[95% CI 0.28-0.95] , p = .03) and (ORs = 0.53 [95% CI 0.29-0.98] , p = .04) ,respectively. No relationship was seen between water-soluble vitamin patterns andrisk of DN in crude and adjusted model but the significance was decreased inadjusted model. The risk of DN was 47% decreased after high adherence offat-soluble vitamin patterns. In addition , we saw a 49% decrease of risk of DN inhigh adherence group of mineral patterns. The findings confirm thatrenal-protective dietary patterns can reduce risk of DN.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress is linked to the development of gestationaldiabetes mellitus (GDM). Maternal antioxidant vitamins in early pregnancy mayplay a role in GDM occurrence. We aimed to investigate the associations ofvitamins A and E in early pregnancy with the risk of GDM and to explore whetherthese antioxidant vitamins can be biomarkers for the early prediction of GDM.METHODS: We carried out a prospective cohort study conducted in Beijing andenrolled pregnant women (n = 667) with vitamins A and E measurements at 9 weeks(IQR 8-10) of gestation and having one-step GDM screened with a 75-g oral glucosetolerance test between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: The vitamin Alevels in early pregnancy were significantly higher in women with GDM than inthose without GDM (p < 0.0001) and positively correlated with fasting bloodglucose. In multivariate models , vitamin A levels were significantly associatedwith GDM (OR , 1.46; 95% CI: 1.14-1.88; p = 0.0032) per SD. A significant trend ofrisk effect on GDM risk across quartiles of vitamin A was observed(p(trend) = 0.016). No significant association of serum vitamin E with GDM wasobserved overall. However , a noted trend of protective effect on GDM risk acrossquartiles of vitamin E/cholesterol ratio was observed (p(trend) = 0.043). In ROCanalysis , the multivariate model consisting of vitamin A and other risk factorsshowed the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.760; 95% CI: 0.705-0.815;p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of vitamin A in early pregnancy weresignificantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Vitamin A has thepotential to be a biomarker indicating pathogenesis of GDM.

TI  - Protective Role of Natural and Semi-Synthetic Tocopherols on TNFα-Induced ROSProduction and ICAM-1 and Cl-2 Expression in HT29 Intestinal Epithelial Cells.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10020160 [doi]
LID - 160
AB  - Vitamin E , a fat-soluble compound , possesses both antioxidant and non-antioxidantproperties. In this study we evaluated , in intestinal HT29 cells , the role ofnatural tocopherols , α-Toc and δ-Toc , and two semi-synthetic derivatives , namelybis-δ-Toc sulfide (δ-Toc)(2)S and bis-δ-Toc disulfide (δ-Toc)(2)S(2) , onTNFα-induced oxidative stress , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) andclaudin-2 (Cl-2) expression. The role of tocopherols was compared to that ofN-acetylcysteine (NAC) , an antioxidant precursor of glutathione synthesis. Theresults show that all tocopherol containing derivatives used , preventedTNFα-induced oxidative stress and the increase of ICAM-1 and Cl-2 expression , andthat (δ-Toc)(2)S and (δ-Toc)(2)S(2) are more effective than δ-Toc and α-Toc. Thebeneficial effects demonstrated were due to tocopherol antioxidant properties ,but suppression of TNFα-induced Cl-2 expression seems not only to be related withantioxidant ability. Indeed , while ICAM-1 expression is strongly related to theintracellular redox state , Cl-2 expression is TNFα-up-regulated by both redox andnon-redox dependent mechanisms. Since ICAM-1 and Cl-2 increase intestinal boweldiseases , and cause excessive recruitment of immune cells and alteration of theintestinal barrier , natural and , above all , semi-synthetic tocopherols may have apotential role as a therapeutic support against intestinal chronic inflammation ,in which TNFα represents an important proinflammatory mediator.

TI  - Clarification of the Complexation Behaviour of 2,6-di-O-Methylated β-Cyclodextrinand Vitamin E and Radical Scavenging Ability of the Complex in Aqueous Solution.
PG  - 1461-1467
LID - 10.5650/jos.ess21064 [doi]
AB  - The precise understanding of the behaviour of vitamin E (α-tocopherol; Toc)complexed with cyclodextrin (CD) additives in aqueous solution is a fundamentalissue for further development of their aqua-related biological applications. Inthis study , the solubilisation and complexation behaviours of Toc withmethyl-substituted CD derivatives and the radical scavenging ability of theresulting complexes were precisely investigated in water media. Several problemswere encountered upon pre-dissolving Toc in an organic solvent prior to theaddition to the water media , such as enhancement of the dispersibility anddecrease in the complexation capacity. Additionally , dispersions were obtained insome cases when mixing CD and Toc even in the absence of an organic solvent;therefore , to perform the measurements , a transparent solution was prepared viafiltration with a nanopore filter. Consequently , unexpectedly , the addition ofcertain CD methylated derivatives did not always enhance the solubility of Tocsignificantly. However , 2,6-di-O-methylated β-CD (2,6-DMCD) formed awater-soluble inclusion complex with Toc , effectively enhancing its solubility. Aphase solubility study indicated the formation of 1:2 or 1:3 Toc/CD inclusioncomplexes , and the interaction of 2,6-DMCD with both the chromanol head and thephytol chain of Toc was revealed by 2D ROESY nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.The interaction between 2,6-DMCD and the chromanol head was also confirmed for a2,6-DMCD-2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-chromanol inclusion complex. Additionally , arapid scavenging effect for molecularly dissolved Toc was demonstrated even in asystem comprising a chromanol head directly encapsulated by CD. Hence , this workelucidated the precise complexation and radical scavenging ability of2,6-DMCD-Toc in an aqueous solution , which paves the way for its biologicalapplications.

TI  - In Vitro Antioxidant and Anti-Glycation Activity of Resveratrol and Its NovelTriester with Trolox.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10010012 [doi]
LID - 12
AB  - Resveratrol (RSV) is well known for its many beneficial activities , but itsunfavorable physicochemical properties impair its effectiveness after systemicand topical administration; thus , several strategies have been investigated toimprove RSV efficacy. With this aim , in this work , we synthesized a novel RSVtriester with trolox , an analogue of vitamin E with strong antioxidant activity.The new RSV derivative (RSVTR) was assayed in vitro to evaluate its antioxidantand anti-glycation activity compared to RSV. RSVTR chemical stability wasassessed at pH 2.0 , 6.8 , and 7.2 and different storage temperatures (5 °C , 22 °C ,and 37 °C). An influence of pH stronger than that of temperature on RSVTRhalf-life values was pointed out , and RSVTR greatest stability was observed at pH7.2 and 5 °C. RSVTR showed a lower antioxidant ability compared to RSV(determined by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay) while itsanti-glycation activity (evaluated using the Maillard reaction) was significantlygreater than that of RSV. The improved ability to inhibit the glycation processwas attributed to a better interaction of RSVTR with albumin owing to itsincreased topological polar surface area value and H-bond acceptor numbercompared to RSV. Therefore , RSVTR could be regarded as a promising anti-glycationagent worthy of further investigations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)in children. Our aim was to analyze the association of dietary andsociodemographic factors with NAFLD in obese children and adolescents. MATERIALSAND METHODS: Thirty-three obese patients from 6-16 years of age were included inthe present analytic cross-sectional study. Obesity was diagnosed with a bodymass index z-score > 2 SD. NAFLD was estimated by liver ultrasound , serum aminotransferases , and elastography. The sociodemographic variables were evaluatedusing validated questionnaires. Diet was estimated through two 24-h recalldietary surveys focused on the quantity of food energy , simple sugars ,polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) , and antioxidants. RESULTS: Hepatic steatosiswas identified by abdominal ultrasound in 13 patients (39.4%) and the serumalanine aminotransferase level was above the upper reference value in 54.2%. Ahigher educational level in both parents , greater monthly food expenditure , and ahigher socioeconomic level were associated with NAFLD. Overall , simple sugar andsaturated fat consumption was above the recommended daily intake , whereas vitaminE and PUFA consumption was below those parameters. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD wasidentified in one-third of the cases. There was an association between NAFLD andsociodemographic variables. Both groups had an increased intake of simple sugarsand a reduced intake of PUFAs. The selective occurrence of NAFLD could be relatedto a genetic predisposition that has been demonstrated in a Mexican population.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Jaundice in newborns is a sign of skin and sclera pigmentation.Hyperbilirubinemia and these phenomena do , however , have a relationship.According to many clinical studies , elevated blood bilirubin and low vitamin E(VE) levels in newborns are associated. The aim of the study was to investigatethe association of oxidative stress of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in patientswho underwent phototherapy with additional vitamin E supplementation (25mg/kg/day over the course of three days) and patients without additional vitaminE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A set of 100 neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemiapatients was enrolled at neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of the pediatricdepartments at Al Azhar University Hospitals during the period from February 2021to October 2022 after obtaining signed written informed consent of all neonates'parents with an explanation of the aim of study. RESULTS: Significant differenceswere found between the studied groups regarding serum bilirubin on the third dayof admission (p = 0.039). Patients who were treated with vitamin E had lowerserum bilirubin on the third day of admission (8.25 ±3.41) than the control group(11.66 ±3.22). Also , among the VE group , serum bilirubin was significantlydecreased on the third day of admission (8.25 ±3.41) compared to zero days ofadmission (14.10 ±4.39) (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E supplementation hasan important role in treatment of indirect hyperbilirubinemia in neonates. Earlyadministration of vitamin E in preterm neonates resulted in a significantdecrease of serum bilirubin and increased total antioxidant capacity. Vitamin Esupplementation in full term decreased the duration of phototherapy.

TI  - CFTR Modulator Therapy with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Alters Plasma Concentrations ofLipid-Soluble Vitamins A and E in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10030483 [doi]
LID - 483
AB  - RATIONALE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) , caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosistransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene , leads to impaired pancreaticfunction and therefore reduced intestinal absorption of lipids and fat-solublevitamins especially in patients with CF developing pancreatic insufficiency (PI).Previous studies showed that CFTR modulator therapy with lumacaftor-ivacaftor(LUM/IVA) in Phe508del-homozygous patients with CF results in improvement ofpulmonary disease and thriving. However , the effects of LUM/IVA on plasmaconcentration of the lipid soluble vitamins A and E remain unknown. OBJECTIVES:To investigate the course of plasma vitamin A and E in patients with CF underLUM/IVA therapy. METHODS: Data from annual follow-up examinations of patientswith CF were obtained to assess clinical outcomes including pulmonary functionstatus , body mass index (BMI) , and clinical chemistry as well as fat-solublevitamins in Phe508del-homozygous CF patients before initiation and during LUM/IVAtherapy. RESULTS: Patients with CF receiving LUM/IVA improved substantially ,including improvement in pulmonary inflammation , associated with a decrease inblood immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 9.4 to 8.2 g/L after two years (p < 0.001).During the same time , plasma vitamin A increased significantly from 1.2 to 1.6µmol/L (p < 0.05) , however , levels above the upper limit of normal were notdetected in any of the patients. In contrast , plasma vitamin E as vitaminE/cholesterol ratio decreased moderately over the same time from 6.2 to 5.5µmol/L (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CFTR modulator therapy with LUM/IVA altersconcentrations of vitamins A and vitamin E in plasma. The increase of vitamin Amust be monitored critically to avoid hypervitaminosis A in patients with CF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have reduced intestinal absorption ofsterols and , despite enhanced endogenous synthesis , low plasma cholesterol.Lumacaftor/ivacaftor CFTR protein modulator therapy is used to improve theclinical outcome of CF patients homozygous for F508del mutation (homo-deltaF508).Aim of the study is to evaluate the cholesterol metabolism and hepatobiliaryinjury/function in adult homo-deltaF508 patients , before and afterlumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment. Baseline parameters in homo-deltaF508 patientswere compared to those in CF patients compound heterozygous for F508del mutationand another severe mutation (hetero-deltaF508). METHODS: Cholesterol metabolismwas evaluated measuring plasma phytosterols and cholestanol , as intestinalabsorption markers , and lathosterol , as liver biosynthesis marker. We quantifiedserum vitamin E , as nutritional marker. We evaluated liver injury by aspartateaminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) , biliary injury byγ-glutamyltransferase (γGT) and AP , and the liver function by bilirubin andalbumin. RESULTS: Before the treatment , homo-deltaF508 patients (n = 20) hadsignificantly lower cholesterol and vitamin E compared to hetero-deltaF508(n = 20). Lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment caused: 1) further reduction ofcholesterol; 2) lathosterol reduction , suggesting a normalization of endogenoussynthesis; 3) cholestanol and vitamin E increment , indicating an improvement oflipid digestion/absorption. Vitamin E difference (after-before treatment) waspositively associated to treatment months. Alkaline phosphatase was also reduced.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest an effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on cholesterolmetabolism and enterohepatic flux in CF patients. However , lumacaftor/ivacaftordoes not promote the increase of cholesterol serum concentration that on thecontrary declines. Further studies are needed to research the real mechanismcausing this reduction.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the capacity of six mycotoxin binders(MTBs) to adsorb vitamins A , D and E in an in vitro system that simulates gastricand intestinal digestion. Experiment 1 evaluated the recovery rate of vitamins A ,D and E in the incubation conditions. In Experiment 2 , the main factors were theMTB (bentonite , clinoptilolite , sepiolite , montmorillonite , active carbon andyeast cell walls) , vitamins (A , D and E) and incubation type (vitamins incubatedseparately or together). The recovery was high for vitamin D (83%) and E (93%) ,but low for vitamin A (23%) , for which no further analyses were conducted. Whenincubated separately , vitamin D was only adsorbed by yeast cell wall (20.2%).Vitamin E adsorption was highest with bentonite (54.5%) and montmorillonite(46.3%) and lowest with sepiolite (16.6%) and active carbon (18.5%). Whenincubated together , vitamin D was not adsorbed by any MTB. Vitamin E adsorptionwas highest in bentonite (61.8%) and montmorillonite (50.7%) and lowest insepiolite (15.4%). Results indicate that the bioavailability of vitamin E , butnot that of vitamin D , may be reduced in the presence of MTBs.

TI  - Tocopherol controls D1 amino acid oxidation by oxygen radicals in Photosystem II.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2019246118 [doi]
LID - e2019246118
AB  - Photosystem II (PSII) is an intrinsic membrane protein complex that functions asa light-driven water:plastoquinone oxidoreductase in oxygenic photosynthesis.Electron transport in PSII is associated with formation of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) responsible for oxidative modifications of PSII proteins. In thisstudy , oxidative modifications of the D1 and D2 proteins by the superoxide anion(O(2)(•-)) and the hydroxyl (HO(•)) radicals were studied in WT and a tocopherolcyclase (vte1) mutant , which is deficient in the lipid-soluble antioxidantα-tocopherol. In the absence of this antioxidant , high-resolution tandem massspectrometry was used to identify oxidation of D1:(130)E to hydroxyglutamic acidby O(2)(•-) at the Pheo(D1) site. Additionally , D1:(246)Y was modified to eithertyrosine hydroperoxide or dihydroxyphenylalanine by O(2)(•-) and HO(•) ,respectively , in the vicinity of the nonheme iron. We propose that α-tocopherolis localized near Pheo(D1) and the nonheme iron , with its chromanol head exposedto the lipid-water interface. This helps to prevent oxidative modification of theamino acid's hydrogen that is bonded to Pheo(D1) and the nonheme iron (viabicarbonate) , and thus protects electron transport in PSII from ROS damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Niosomes are nonionic surfactant-based vesicles thatexhibit certain unique features which make them favorable nanocarriers forsustained drug delivery in cancer therapy. Biodistribution studies are criticalin assessing if a nanocarrier system has preferential accumulation in a tumor byenhanced permeability and retention effect. Radiolabeling of nanocarriers withradioisotopes such as Technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) will allow for the tracking of thenanocarrier noninvasively via nuclear imaging. The purpose of this study was toformulate , characterize , and optimize (99m)Tc-labeled niosomes. METHODS: Niosomeswere prepared from a mixture of sorbitan monostearate 60 , cholesterol , andsynthesized D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000succinate-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (synthesis confirmed by (1)H and(13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Niosomes were radiolabeled bysurface chelation with reduced (99m)Tc. Parameters affecting the radiolabelingefficiency such as concentration of stannous chloride (SnCl(2)·H(2)O) , pH , andincubation time were evaluated. In vitro stability of radiolabeled niosomes wasstudied in 0.9% saline and human serum at 37°C for up to 8 hours. RESULTS:Niosomes had an average particle size of 110.2±0.7 nm , polydispersity index of0.229±0.008 , and zeta potential of -64.8±1.2 mV. Experimental data revealed that30 µg/mL of SnCl(2)·H(2)O was the optimal concentration of reducing agentrequired for the radiolabeling process. The pH and incubation time required toobtain high radiolabeling efficiency was pH 5 and 15 minutes , respectively.(99m)Tc-labeled niosomes exhibited high radiolabeling efficiency (>90%) andshowed good in vitro stability for up to 8 hours. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge ,this is the first study published on the surface chelation of niosomes with(99m)Tc. The formulated (99m)Tc-labeled niosomes possessed high radiolabelingefficacy , good stability in vitro , and show good promise for potential use innuclear imaging in the future.

TI  - Design , Green Synthesis and Tailoring of Vitamin E TPGS Augmented NiosomalNano-Carrier of Pyrazolopyrimidines as Potential Anti-Liver and Breast CancerAgents with Accentuated Oral Bioavailability.

LID - 330
AB  - VEGF plays a crucial role in cancer development , angiogenesis and progression ,principally liver and breast cancer. It is vital to uncover novel chemicalcandidates of VEGFR inhibitors to develop more potent anti-breast and anti-livercancer agents than the currently available candidates , sorafenib and regorafenib ,that face resistance obstacles and severe side effects. Herein , ninepyrazolopyrimidine derivatives were designed , synthesized as sorafenib andregorafenib analogues and screened for their in vitro cytotoxic and growthinhibition activities against four human cancer cell lines , namely breast cancer(Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) , hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) type(HepG2) , lung carcinoma (A-549) and human colorectal carcinoma-116 (HCT-116)).Among the tested compounds , compounds 1 , 2a , 4b and 7 showed the uppermostcytotoxic activities against all aforementioned cell lines with IC(50) estimatesvarying from 6 to 50 µM , among which compound 7 showed the best inhibitoryactivity on all tested compounds. Stunningly , compound 7 showed the bestsignificant inhibition of the VEGFR-2 protein expression level (72.3%) ascompared to the control and even higher than that produced with sorafenib andregorafenib (70.4% and 55.6% , respectively). Modeling studies provided evidencefor the possible interactions of the synthesized compounds with the key residuesof the ATP binding sites on the hinge region and the "DFG out" motif of VEGFR-2kinase. Collectively , our present study suggests that pyrazolopyrimidinederivatives are a novel class of anti-cancer drug candidates to inhibitVEGF-VEGFR function. Aspiring to promote constrained aqueous solubility , hencepoor oral bioavailability of the developed lead molecule , 7 and 2a-chargedD-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) surface-coated niosomeswere successfully constructed , adopting a thin film hydration technique strivingto overcome these pitfalls. A 2(3) full factorial design was involved in order toinvestigate the influence of formulation variables: type of surfactant , eitherSpan 60 or Span 40; surfactant:cholesterol ratio (8:2 or 5:5) along with theamount of TPGS (25 mg or 50 mg) on the characteristics of the nanosystem. F2 andS2 were picked as the optimum formula for compounds 2a and 7 with desirabilityvalues of 0.907 and 0.903 , respectively. In addition , a distinguished improvementwas observed in the compound's oral bioavailability and cytotoxic activity afterbeing included in the nano-TPGS-coated niosomal system relative to theunformulated compound. The nano-TPGS-coated niosomal system increased thehepatocellular inhibitory activity four times fold of compound 7a (1.6 µM) andtwo-fold of 2a (3 µM) relative to the unformulated compounds (6 µM and 6.2 µM ,respectively).

TI  - Effect of Drying Methods on Peanut Quality during Storage.
PG  - 57-66
LID - 10.5650/jos.ess21146 [doi]
AB  - Storage is an important step after peanut harvest and drying. Many factors couldaffect the peanut quality during storage. The quality change differences ofpeanut after being dried by solar radiation and at 35°C , 40°C , 45°C , 50°C duringlater storage were investigated , including moisture content (MC) and germinationpercentage (GP) of peanut kernels , acid value (AV) , peroxide value (PV) , iodinevalue (IV) , vitamin E (VE) content and fatty acid composition (FAC) of extractedpeanut oil. And the impact of four storage conditions , air-room temperature(A-RT) , air-low temperature (A-LT) , vacuum-room temperature (V-RT) andnitrogen-room temperature (N-RT) on peanut quality after 10 months' storage werealso studied in this paper. The results revealed that drying conditions had onlya little influence on peanut quality during later storage. Peanut dried by solarradiation was more easily oxidized than that dried under other drying conditions.The effects of storage time were much greater. The GP , AV , PV , VE content andFAC , showed significantly changes along with storage. GP and VE contentdecreased , AV and PV increased , and some linoleic acid was oxidized to oleic acidafter 10 months' storage. In addition , A-LT exhibited best performance in keepingpeanut quality than A-RT , V-RT and N-RT , which demonstrated that low temperaturewas more advantageous for peanut storage than controlled atmosphere. Theseresults above would provide useful information and reference for the peanutstorage to apply in food industry.

TI  - Vitamin E supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis.
PG  - CD009422
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009422.pub4 [doi]
LID - CD009422
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with cystic fibrosis are at an increased risk of fat-solublevitamin deficiency , including vitamin E. Vitamin E deficiency can cause a host ofconditions such as haemolytic anaemia , cerebellar ataxia and cognitivedifficulties. Vitamin E supplementation is widely recommended for people withcystic fibrosis and aims to ameliorate this deficiency. This is an updatedversion of the review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of any level ofvitamin E supplementation on the frequency of vitamin E deficiency disorders inpeople with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Group'sCystic Fibrosis Trials Register and also searched international online trialregistries for any ongoing clinical trials that were not identified during ourregister search. Date of last search of the Register: 11 August 2020. Date oflast search of international online trial registries: 20 July 2020. SELECTIONCRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trialscomparing any preparation of vitamin E supplementation to placebo or nosupplement , regardless of dosage or duration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Twoauthors extracted outcome data from each study (published information) andassessed the risk of bias of each included study. They assessed the quality ofthe evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies with a total of 141participants were included in the review , two of these were in children (aged sixmonths to 14.5 years) , and two did not specify participants' age. All studiesused different formulations and doses of vitamin E for various durations oftreatment (10 days to six months). Two studies compared the supplementation offat-soluble as well as water-soluble formulations to no supplementation indifferent arms of the same study. A third study compared a water-solubleformulation to a placebo; and in the fourth study a fat-soluble formulation ofvitamin E was assessed against placebo. There was limited detail aboutrandomisation and blinding in the included studies which compromises the qualityof the evidence base for the review. The heterogeneous mix of the formulationswith differing biovailabilities among these studies also limits thegeneralisability of the data to the wider cystic fibrosis population. None of thestudies in either comparison report the review's primary outcomes of vitamin Etotal lipid ratio or the incidence of vitamin E-specific deficiency disorders , orthe secondary outcomes lung function or quality of life. Water-soluble vitamin EWater-soluble vitamin E may improve serum vitamin E levels compared with controlat six months , one study (45 participants) , mean difference (MD) 19.74 umol/L(95% confidence interval (CI) 13.48 to 26.00) (low-quality evidence). Similarresults were also seen at one month , two studies (32 participants) , MD 17.66umol/L (95% CI 10.59 to 24.74) and at three months , one study (45 participants) ,MD 11.61 umol/L (95% CI 4.77 to 18.45). Only one study (45 participants) reportedweight (secondary outcome of growth and nutritional status) at one and sixmonths , but showed no difference between treatment and control at either timepoint. Fat-soluble vitamin E Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levelsof serum vitamin E at one month with fat-soluble vitamin E compared with control ,MD 13.59 umol/L (95% CI 9.52 to 17.66); however , at three months one study (36participants) showed no difference between treatment and control. No studies inthis comparison reported on growth or nutritional status. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:Vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels inpeople with cystic fibrosis , although evidence we assessed was low quality. Nodata on other outcomes of interest were available to allow conclusions about anyother benefits of this therapy. In future , larger studies are needed , especiallyin people already being treated with enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes andsupplemented with vitamin E , to look at more specific outcome measures such asvitamin E status , lung function and nutritional status. Future studies could alsolook at the optimal dose of vitamin E required to achieve maximal clinicaleffectiveness.

AB  - Abetalipoproteinemia (FHBL-SD1) and chylomicron retention disease (FHBL-SD3) arerare recessive disorders of lipoprotein metabolism due to mutations in MTTP andSAR1B genes , respectively , which lead to defective chylomicron formation andsecretion. This results in lipid and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption , whichinduces severe neuro-ophthalmic complications. Currently , treatment combines alow-fat diet with high-dose vitamin A and E supplementation but still fails innormalizing serum vitamin E levels and providing complete ophthalmic protection.To explore these persistent complications , we developed two knock-out cell modelsof FHBL-SD1 and FHBL-SD3 using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique in Caco-2/TC7 cells. DNAsequencing , RNA quantification and Western blotting confirmed the introduction ofmutations with protein knock-out in four clones associated with i) impaired lipiddroplet formation and ii) defective triglyceride (-57.0 ± 2.6% to -83.9 ± 1.6%)and cholesterol (-35.3 ± 4.4% to -60.6 ± 3.5%) secretion. A significant decreasein α-tocopherol secretion was also observed in these clones (-41.5 ± 3.7% to-97.2 ± 2.8%) , even with the pharmaceutical forms of vitamin E:tocopherol-acetate and tocofersolan (α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate1000). MTTP silencing led to a more severe phenotype than SAR1B silencing , whichis consistent with clinical observations. Our cellular models thus provide anefficient tool to experiment with therapeutic strategies and will allow progressin understanding the mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism.

LID - 10.3390/antiox10121875 [doi]
LID - 1875
AB  - Radioprotective effects of vitamin C and vitamin E as a water-soluble and alipid-soluble agent , respectively , were investigated at the molecular levelduring the imposition of gamma radiation-induced structural changes to bovineserum albumin (BSA) at the therapeutic dose of 3 Gy. Secondary and tertiarystructural changes of control and irradiated BSA samples were investigated usingcircular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The preirradiation tests showednonspecific and reversible binding of vitamins C and E to BSA. Secondary andtertiary structures of irradiated BSA considerably changed in the absence of thevitamins. Upon irradiation , α-helices of BSA transitioned to beta motifs andrandom coils , and the fluorescence emission intensity decreased relative tononirradiated BSA. In the presence of the vitamins C or E , however , theirradiated BSA was protected from these structural changes caused by reactiveoxygen species (ROS). The two vitamins exhibited different patterns of attachmentto the protein surface , as inspected by blind docking , and their mechanisms ofprotection were different. The hydrophilicity of vitamin C resulted in thepredominant scavenging of ROS in the solvent , whereas hydrophobic vitamin Elocalized on the nonpolar patches of the BSA surface , where it did not only forma barrier for diffusing ROS but also encountered them as an antioxidant andneutralized them thanks to the moderate BSA binding constant. Very lowconcentrations of vitamins C or E (0.005 mg/mL) appear to be sufficient toprevent the oxidative damage of BSA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to the increasing interest in public health research ofantioxidant micronutrients and the inaccuracy of routine serum concentrations ofthe fat-soluble vitamins A (retinol) and E (DL-α-tocopherol) measurements , wedeveloped a reliable , highly sensitive , robust and rapid method for thequantification of two clinically important lipophilic antioxidants in serum usinga reverse-phase HPLC/DAD method. METHOD: Sample preparation and analyticalconditions that would affect extraction efficiency and quantitative results ofvitamins A and E were investigated and optimized. Vitamins A and E were extractedfrom serum via liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). After adequate sample preparation ,the samples were injected directly into the HPLC system with diode-array detector(DAD). Chromatographic separation was completed in 7 minutes for vitamins A andE. With vitamin A acetate and vitamin E acetate as internal standards , the methodwas applied to the measurement of vitamins A and E in human serum. RESULTS: Weevaluated method linearity , accuracy (recovery rate and trueness) , precision ,carryover , limit of quantitation and limit of detection , and measurementuncertainty. The method was evaluated for trueness using NIST Standard ReferenceMaterial SRM 968f. The serum concentration of the studied compounds had a goodlinear relationship in the range of 0.05 ~ 3.0 μg/mL concentration (r ＝ 0.9998) ,with 0.0077 μg/mL detection limit and 0.025 μg/mL quantitative limit for vitaminA , respectively , and 1.0 ~ 60.0 μg/mL concentration (r ＝ 0.9999) , with 0.40 μg/mLdetection limit and 0.50 μg/mL quantitative limit for vitamin E , respectively.The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were calculated by usingthree concentrations (1 , 2 , and 3) of the studied compounds in human serumsamples. Intra-assay and inter-assay precision were 1.23%-4.97% and 0.97%-3.79%for vitamin A , respectively , and 0.64%-4.07% and 0.81%-5.96% for vitamin E ,respectively. The average recovery rates were 100.98% for vitamin A , and 99.21%for vitamin E , respectively. The carryover rate of vitamins A and E was below 1%.As for the evaluation of accuracy , the biases were <± 5% by comparing with NISTstandard reference material SRM 968f. CONCLUSION: The method is a simple sampletreatment procedure for the determination of fat-soluble vitamins A and E inhuman serum with high sensitivity and specificity. The proposed method could berecommended as a candidate reference method for the determination of serumconcentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A and E in human serum.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Currently , no NASH-specific therapies are approved by the US Food andDrug Administration. This study aimed to compare the clinical effect of vitamin E(Vit. E) , Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) and pentoxifylline (PTX) on Egyptianpatients with NASH with exploration of their possible roles on inflammatorycytokines and chemokines mainly Interleukin 6 (IL6) and Monocyte ChemoattractantProtein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a 3-month , randomized ,single-blind study in 102 Egyptian NASH patients who were divided into threegroups; group 1 received Vit. E 400 mg twice a day , group 2 received UDCA 250 mgtwice a day and group 3 received PTX 400 mg twice daily. Liver aminotransferases(AST , ALT) , IL6 , CCL2/MCP-1 , albumin , bilirubin , and lipid panel were measuredboth before and after intervention intake. RESULTS: A significant decrease wasfound in liver aminotransferases , serum cytokine and chemokine in participantsafter Vit. E , UDCA or PTX intake. Compared to the UDCA and PTX groups , liveraminotransferases , serum cytokine and chemokine showed a more statisticallysignificant reduction after Vit. E administration (50% , 43% , 57% and 55% for ALT ,AST , IL6 and CCL2/MCP-1 , respectively). In contrast , other biochemical testsshowed non-significant change after any drug intake. None of the tested drugsshowed significant safety issues in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment withVit. E , UDCA and PTX was both safe and effective in improving hepaticaminotransferases and inflammatory markers in Egyptian NASH patients. Thesuperior effect of Vit. E compared to UDCA and PTX may suggest that oxidativestress plays a key role in disease progression of NASH patients. Moreover , IL6and CCL2/MCP-1 may be used with or without ALT for treatment evaluation of NASHpeople.

AB  - Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved organic dye with near-infraredabsorption and fluorescence. Over the years , many efforts to improve thephotophysical and pharmacokinetic properties of ICG have investigated numerousnanoparticle formulations , especially liposomes with membrane-embedded ICG. Aseries of systematic absorption and fluorescence experiments , including FRETexperiments using ICG as a fluorescence energy acceptor , found that ICG transfersspontaneously from liposomes to albumin protein residing in the external solutionwith a half-life of ∼10 min at 37 °C. Moreover , transfer of ICG from liposomemembranes to external albumin reduces light-activated leakage fromthermosensitive liposomes with membrane-embedded ICG. A survey of lipophilicliposome additives discovered that the presence of clinically approvedantioxidant , α-tocopherol , greatly increases ICG retention in the liposomes(presumably by forming favorable aromatic stacking interactions) , inhibits ICGphotobleaching and prevents albumin-induced reduction of light-triggered liposomeleakage. This new insight will help researchers with the specific task ofoptimizing ICG-containing liposomes for fluorescence imaging orphototherapeutics. More broadly , the results suggest a broader design conceptconcerning light triggered liposome leakage , that is , proximity of the lightabsorbing dye to the bilayer membrane is a critical design feature that impactsthe extent of liposome leakage.

TI  - Increased Water-Solubility and Maintained Antioxidant Power of Resveratrol by ItsEncapsulation in Vitamin E TPGS Micelles: A Potential Nutritional Supplement forChronic Liver Disease.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13081128 [doi]
LID - 1128
AB  - Children affected by chronic liver disease exhibit impaired neurocognitivedevelopment and growth due to the low absorption and digestion of nutrients.Furthermore , malnutrition is an adverse prognostic factor in livertransplantation as it is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality.D-α-tocopheryl-polyethylene-glycol-succinate (TPGS) is currently administered peros as a vitamin E source to improve children's survival and well-being; however ,TPGS alone does not reverse spinocerebellar degeneration and lipid peroxidation.To potentiate the effects of TPGS , we loaded micelles with resveratrol (RES) , anatural polyphenol , with antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities , which hasdemonstrated protective action in the liver. Firstly , we investigated thesuitability of TPGS to encapsulate RES in micelles by means of a phase-solubilitystudy , then RES-TPGS formulations were prepared via solvent casting and solventdiffusion evaporation methods. RES-TPGS colloidal dispersions showed small meandiameters (12 nm) , low polydispersity , and quite neutral Zeta potentials. Theformulations showed a sustained drug release and a good drug loading capacity ,further confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry.RES-TPGSs exhibited unaltered antioxidant activity compared to pristine RES viathe DPPH assay and a significant reduction in toxicity compared to empty TPGS onHaCaT cells. Thus , RES-TPGS micelles may overcome the challenges of current liverdisease therapy by providing more protective effects thanks to the antioxidantactivity of RES and by reducing the surfactant toxicity on normal cells.

LID - 1203480
AB  - Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) is the most common naturallyoccurring heart disease in dogs. There is a lack of data on antioxidant statusand oxidative damage in dogs with MMVD stage B1 according to the American Collegeof Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM B1). The aim of this study was toinvestigate antioxidant status (plasma vitamin E , lipid-standardized vitamin E(LS-VitE) , antioxidant capacity of lipid-(ACL) and water-soluble antioxidants ,whole blood glutathione peroxidase and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase) , andlipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)] in dogs with MMVD ACVIM B1. Serumcholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured to calculate LS-VitE.Fourteen dogs with MMVD ACVIM B1 and 12 control dogs were included in the study.Dogs with MMVD had significantly higher vitamin E , ACL , MDA , and cholesterolconcentrations and significantly higher LS-VitE values than control dogs. Nosignificant correlations between MDA and antioxidant parameters were determinedin either group. In conclusion , oxidative damage to lipids is already present andthe antioxidant status is altered but not depleted in dogs with MMVD ACVIM B1.The antioxidant response to increased oxidative damage consists mainly of theactivation of fat-soluble antioxidants. Further research is needed to evaluatethe efficacy and targets of early antioxidant supplementation to prevent orameliorate oxidative stress and mitigate disease progression in dogs withearly-stage MMVD.

AB  - AIM: To determine whether the use of a mixed polymeric micelle delivery systembased on vitamin E succinate (VES)-grafted-chitosan oligosaccharide(CSO)/VES-grafted-chitosan (CS) mixed micelles (VES-g-CSO/VES-g-CS MM) enhancesthe delivery of C-DMSA , a theranostic fluorescent probe , for Hg(2+) detection anddetoxification in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Mixed micelles self-assembled fromtwo polymers , VES-g-CSO and VES-g-CS , were used to load C-DMSA and affordedC-DMSA@VES-g-CSO/VES-g-CS MM for cell and in vivo applications. Fluorescencemicroscopy was used to assess C-DMSA cellular uptake and Hg(2+) detection in L929cells. C-DMSA@VES-g-CSO/VES-g-CS MM was then administered intravenously. Hg(2+)detection was assessed by fluorescence microscopy in terms of bio-distributionwhile detoxification efficacy in Hg(2+)-poisoned rat models was evaluated interms of mercury contents in blood and in liver. RESULTS: The C-DMSA loaded mixedmicelles , C-DMSA@VES-g-CSO/VES-g-CS MM , significantly enhanced cellular uptakeand detoxification efficacy of C-DMSA in Hg(2+) pretreated human L929 cells.Evidence from the reduction of liver coefficient , mercury contents in liver andblood , alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities in Hg(2+)poisoned SD rats treated with the mixed micelles strongly supported that themicelles were effective for Hg(2+) detoxification in vivo. Furthermore , ex vivofluorescence imaging experiments also supported enhanced Hg(2+) detection in ratliver. CONCLUSION: The mixed polymeric micelle delivery system couldsignificantly enhance cell uptake and efficacy of a theranostic probe for Hg(2+)detection and detoxification treatment in vitro and in vivo. Moreover , thisnanoparticle drug delivery system could achieve targeted detection anddetoxification in liver.

AB  - As integral regulators in plant development and stress response , microRNAs(miRNAs) themselves need to be tightly regulated. Here , we show that tocopherols(vitamin E) , lipid-soluble antioxidants synthesized from tyrosine inchloroplasts , positively regulate the biogenesis of miRNAs. Tocopherols arerequired for the accumulation of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) , aretrograde inhibitor of the nuclear exoribonucleases (XRN) , which may protectprimary miRNAs from being degraded and promote mature miRNA production. Suchregulation is involved in heat-induced accumulation of miR398 and plantacquisition of heat tolerance. Our study reveals a chloroplast-to-nucleussignaling mechanism that favors miRNA biogenesis under heat and possibly otherenvironmental perturbations.

TI  - Chemical Composition , Tocopherol and Carotenoid Content of Seeds from DifferentAndean Lupin (Lupinus mutabilis) Ecotypes.
PG  - 98-104
LID - 10.1007/s11130-021-00880-0 [doi]
AB  - Andean lupin (Lupinus mutabilis) seeds are appreciated for their high protein andlipid contents and have potential applications as ingredients in food , cosmetic ,and pharmaceutical industries. Nevertheless , the information about the seedcomposition (especially in lipophilic antioxidants) of ecotypes from distinctcropping areas is currently limited. Thus , the aim of the present research was toassess the morphological characteristics , chemical composition , tocopherol andcarotenoid contents of the seeds of 33 Andean lupin ecotypes from differentPeruvian regions , along with three L. albus , one L. angustifolius and one L.luteus controls. Significant differences were noted among the Andean ecotypes forall analyzed features. The protein , lipid and ash contents were 32.0-46.9 ,13.6-18.6 and 2.7-4.4 g/100 g dry matter (DM) , respectively. The seeds were richin tocopherols (172.1-249.8 mg/kg DM; γ-tocopherol was 98% of total tocols) andlow in carotenoids (0.69-2.89 mg/kg DM). Debittering increased the tocopherolcontent (227.0-378.2 mg/kg DM) , probably because of the soluble components loss ,although the carotenoid concentration remained unchanged. The Andean lupins hadhigher protein , lipid and tocopherol contents than L. albus and L. angustifolius;the L. luteus values were within the L. mutabilis range. These results suggestthat L. mutabilis harbors nutritional characteristics that are well suited tomodern food trends.

AB  - Capsanthin , like other carotenoids , exhibits poor aqueous solubility , poorstability , and low/variable oral bioavailability that limit its utility as anutraceutical. In this study , we describe the development of anhydrousnanoemulsion preconcentrate of capsanthin , which upon dilution with water ,spontaneously forms nanoemulsion resulting in improved solubility of capsanthinwithout compromising its chemical stability and antioxidant activity. We choseFood and Drug Administration-approved ingredients to develop capsanthinnanoemulsion preconcentrates. The optimized capsanthin nanoemulsionpreconcentrate , upon dilution with water or buffers , yielded the nanoemulsionwith size <50 nm and showed ∼8-fold higher capsanthin release in 1 h in 0.1 N HClin vitro compared with pristine capsanthin. The 3-month stability studies at 25°Con the capsanthin nanoemulsion preconcentrate showed that capsanthin retained thephysical and chemical stability with no alteration in antioxidant activityindicating that nanoemulsion preconcentrate can be used to effectively delivercapsanthin for health benefits.

LID - S0261-5614(19)33071-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2019.09.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Micronutrient supplementation has been extensively explored as astrategy to improve health and reduce risk of chronic diseases. Fat-solublevitamins like A and E with their antioxidant properties and mechanisticinteractions with lipoproteins , have potentially a key impact on lipid metabolismand lipidemia. OBJECTIVE: The impact of micronutrients on lipid metabolismrequires further investigation including characterization of plasma lipidomefollowing supplementation and any cause-effect on circulating lipids. DESIGN: Inthis study , we elucidate the effect and associations of a multi-micronutrientintervention in Brazilian children and teens with lipoprotein alterations andlipid metabolism. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests a combination of short andlong-term impact of supplementation on lipid metabolism , potentially mediatedprimarily by α-tocopherol (vitamin E) and retinol (vitamin A). Among the lipidclasses , levels of phospholipids , lysophospholipids , and cholesterol esters wereimpacted the most along with differential incorporation of stearic , palmitic ,oleic and arachidonic acids. Integrated analysis with proteomic data suggestedpotential links to supplementation-mediated alterations in protein levels ofphospholipases and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). CONCLUSIONS:Associations between the observed differences in lipidemia , total triglyceride ,and VLDL-cholesterol levels suggest that micronutrients may play a role inreducing these risk factors for cardiovascular disease in children. This wouldrequire further investigation.

TI  - Vitamins A , D , E status as related to supplementation and lung disease markers inyoung children with cystic fibrosis.
PG  - 935-944
LID - 10.1002/ppul.25825 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The variable response to fat-soluble vitamin supplementation in youngchildren with cystic fibrosis (CF) , and factors contributing to this variability ,remain under-investigated. OBJECTIVE: To determine if recommended supplementdoses normalize serum vitamins A (retinol) , D (25-hydroxy-vitamin D , 25OHD) , andE (α-tocopherol) , and identify factors predictive of achieving sufficiency , inchildren with CF in the first 3 years of life. DESIGN: We studied 144 infantsborn during 2012-2017 and diagnosed with CF through newborn screening. Serumretinol , 25OHD , α-tocopherol and plasma cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 , IL-8 ,IL-10 , and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured in early infancy andyearly thereafter. Vitamin supplement intakes and respiratory microbiology wereassessed every 1-2 months in infancy and quarterly thereafter. RESULTS: Theprevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) at all ages combined wassignificantly higher (22%) compared to vitamin A (<200 ng/ml , 3%) and vitamin E(<5 µg/ml , 5%). All children were vitamin A sufficient by age 2 years. Vitamin Einsufficiency was rare. Only 42% were early responders of vitamin D and 17%remain insufficient despite high supplement intakes. IL-6 was positivelycorrelated , while IL-8 , IL-10 , and TNF-α were negatively correlated , with retinoland 25OHD. Multiple regression analysis revealed that supplement dose , season ,α-tocopherol , pancreatic insufficiency , respiratory infections and IL-10 weresignificant predictors of 25OHD. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis through newborn screeningcoupled with supplementation normalized serum retinol and α-tocopherol in almostall infants with CF by age 3 years. However , response to vitamin D supplements inyoung children with CF occurred later and variably despite early and sustainedsupplementation.

TI  - Correlation of Serum IGF-1 and sFlt-1 Levels with Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes inPatients with Severe Preeclampsia.
PG  - 364-369
LID - AT8003 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to analyze the association of serum insulin-like growthfactor 1 (IGF-1) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) levels withadverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with severe preeclampsia (SPE). METHODS: Atotal of 108 patients with SPE who received treatment in Tianjin MedicalUniversity General Hospital in China from January 2017 to December 2019 wereselected for the study. According to the presence or lack of presence of adversepregnancy outcomes , the patients were divided into the occurrence group (n = 34)and the nonoccurrence group (n = 74). Before treatment , patient serum vitamin A(VA) , vitamin E (VE) , IGF-1 and sFlt-1 levels were measured. Logistic regressionanalysis was performed for the correlation of serum IGF-1 and sFlt-1 with adversepregnancy outcomes in patients with severe SPE. In addition , a Receiver OperatorCharacteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to test the prediction value of patientserum VA , VE , IGF-1 and sFlt-1 levels. RESULTS: Compared with the nonoccurrencegroup , patients in the occurrence group had much lower serum VA , VE and IGF-1levels and significantly higher sFlt-1 levels. Logistic regression analysisrevealed that serum levels of VA , VE , IGF-1 and sFlt-1 before treatment wereassociated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with SPE , and the ROCcurve proved the accuracy of serum VA , VE , IGF-1 and sFlt-1 levels in predictingadverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with SPE. CONCLUSION: Abnormal expressionof serum IGF-1 and sFlt-1 before treatment in patients with SPE is correlatedwith adverse pregnancy outcomes. Clinically , the risk for adverse pregnancyoutcomes can be predicted and intervention instituted by detecting pretreatmentserum IGF-1 and sFlt-1 expression in patients with SPE.

TI  - Fat-Soluble Vitamins A , D , E , and K: Review of the Literature and Points ofInterest for the Clinician.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13133641 [doi]
LID - 3641
AB  - Fat-soluble vitamins , including vitamins A , D , E , and K , are energy-freemolecules that are essential to the body's functioning and life. Their intake isalmost exclusively exogenous , i.e. , dietary. As a result , fat-soluble vitamindeficiencies are rarer in industrialized countries than in countries with limitedresources. Certain groups of people are particularly affected , such as newbornsor growing children , pregnant or breastfeeding women , and elderly or isolatedindividuals. Deficiencies in vitamins A , D , E , and K are also relatively frequentin subjects with digestive tract disorders , liver diseases , chronic pathologies ,or in intensive care patients. Deficiencies or excesses of fat-soluble vitaminsare responsible for a variety of more or less specific clinical pictures. Certainsyndromes are typical of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency , such as the combinationof ophthalmological and immunity impairments in the case of vitamin A deficiencyor hemorrhagic syndrome and osteopenia in the case of vitamin E deficiency. Thisis also the case for osteomalacia , muscular weakness , even falls , and rickets inthe case of vitamin D deficiency. Diagnosis of a deficiency in one of thefat-soluble vitamins relies on blood tests , which are not always essential forroutine use. In this context , a therapeutic test may be proposed. Treatment ofdeficiencies requires vitamin supplementation , a well-balanced diet , andtreatment of the cause.

TI  - Protective Effect of Vitamin E on laying performance , antioxidant capacity , andimmunity in laying hens challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis.
PG  - 5847-5854
LID - 10.3382/ps/pez227 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E (VE) has proven to function as potent lipid-soluble antioxidant , asignaling molecule , and a regulator of the immune system. The objective of thestudy was to assess the protective effect of VE on laying performance ,antioxidant capacity , and immunity in laying hens exposed to SalmonellaEnteritidis (SE). A total of 80 32-week-old salmonella-free double negativeHy-Line brown laying hens were randomly assigned to 4 treatments with 20replicates each (1 bird per replicate) according to a 2 × 2 factorial design with2 VE supplementation levels [0 IU/kg (VE0) vs. 30 IU/kg (VE30)] , and 2 challengetreatments [SE vs. physiological saline solution (PS)]. During the last 3 D ofweek 43 of age , birds were orally challenged with 1.0 mL suspension of 109 cfu/mLS. Enteritidis daily , whereas the birds of negative treatments (VE0) received thesame volume of PS. The egg mass of VE0 treatment decreased (P < 0.05) in contrastto VE treatment after challenge. The serum concentrations of interleukins (IL-1βand IL-6) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of SE treatments increased (P < 0.05)at week 44 and week 46 , respectively. In both VE30 treatments , the decrease (P <0.05) in birds' mortality was associated with higher IgA , IgG , IgM concentrationsat week 44 , and higher IgA , IgM concentrations at week 46. There is aninteraction (P < 0.05) between SE challenge and VE levels with regard to feedconversion , daily egg mass , and serum MDA , IgA , and IgM levels. It can beconcluded that supplemental VE (30 IU/kg) in diets for laying hens may alleviateoxidative and immune stress due to SE challenge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to 30% of thepopulation. Clinical trials have questioned the role of vitamin E in thetreatment of NAFLD with or without other interventions , with still no firmconclusion reached. This study aims to examine the efficiency of vitamin E aloneor combined in the management of NAFLD. METHODS: We performed a systematicliterature search on PubMed , Scopus , Embase , Ovid , EBSCO host , Science Direct ,Web of Science , and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ofthe role of vitamin E alone or combined in NAFLD patients. Extracted manuscriptsreported data on biochemical , histological , anthropometric , and metabolicoutcomes. Baseline characteristics , settings , dosage , and frequency were alsocollected. RESEARCH: A total of 1317 patients from 15 RCTs were included in oursystematic review and meta-analysis. Vitamin E was superior at improving alanineaminotransferase (ALT) , aspartate aminotransferase (AST) , NAFLD activity score(NAS) , and fibrosis in short- and long-term follow up in the adult population ,and long-term follow up in the pediatric population. Improvements in metabolicoutcomes were best noticed in pediatric patients. Results from multipleregression models showed a significant association between ALT-AST levels andvitamin E dose. AST levels had a significant effect on NAS , and patients with abaseline AST > 50 IU/l showed more promising results. Changes in weight and bodymass index (BMI) were strongly associated with changes in NAS. CONCLUSION:Current evidence affirms that vitamin E - whether alone or combined - improvesbiochemical and histological outcomes in adults and pediatric patients.

TI  - Formulation of Nanomicelles to Improve the Solubility and the Oral Absorption ofSilymarin.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24091688 [doi]
LID - 1688
AB  - Two novel nanomicellar formulations were developed to improve the poor aqueoussolubility and the oral absorption of silymarin. Polymeric nanomicelles made ofSoluplus and mixed nanomicelles combining Soluplus with d-α-tocopherolpolyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS) were prepared using the thinfilm method. Physicochemical parameters were investigated , in particular theaverage diameter , the homogeneity (expressed as polydispersity index) , the zetapotential , the morphology , the encapsulation efficiency , the drug loading , thecritical micellar concentration and the cloud point. The sizes of ~60 nm , thenarrow size distribution (polydispersity index ≤0.1) and the encapsulationefficiency >92% indicated the high affinity between silymarin and the core of thenanomicelles. Solubility studies demonstrated that the solubility of silymarinincreased by ~6-fold when loaded into nanomicelles. Furthermore , the physical andchemical parameters of SLM-loaded formulations stored at room temperature and inrefrigerated conditions (4 °C) were monitored over three months. In vitrostability and release studies in media miming the physiological conditions werealso performed. In addition , both formulations did not alter the antioxidantproperties of silymarin as evidenced by the 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical(DPPH) assay. The potential of the nanomicelles to increase the intestinalabsorption of silymarin was firstly investigated by the parallel artificialmembrane permeability assay. Subsequently , transport studies employing Caco-2cell line demonstrated that mixed nanomicelles statistically enhanced thepermeability of silymarin compared to polymeric nanomicelles and unformulatedextract. Finally , the uptake studies indicated that both nanomicellarformulations entered into Caco-2 cells via energy-dependent mechanisms.

TI  - α-Tocopherol Attenuates the Severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced Pneumonia.
PG  - 234-243
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2019-0185OC [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a lethal pathogen that causes high mortality andmorbidity in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. The type IIIsecretion system (T3SS) of P. aeruginosa mediates many of the adverse effects ofinfection with this pathogen , including increased lung permeability in aToll-like receptor 4/RhoA/PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1)-dependentmanner. α-Tocopherol has antiinflammatory properties that may make it a usefuladjunct in treatment of this moribund infection. We measured transendothelial andtransepithelial resistance , RhoA and PAI-1 activation , stress fiber formation , P.aeruginosa T3SS exoenzyme (ExoY) intoxication into host cells , and survival in amurine model of pneumonia in the presence of P. aeruginosa and pretreatment withα-tocopherol. We found that α-tocopherol alleviated P. aeruginosa-mediatedalveolar endothelial and epithelial paracellular permeability by inhibiting RhoA ,in part , via PAI-1 activation , and increased survival in a mouse model of P.aeruginosa pneumonia. Furthermore , we found that α-tocopherol decreased theactivation of RhoA and PAI-1 by blocking the injection of T3SS exoenzymes intoalveolar epithelial cells. P. aeruginosa is becoming increasingly antibioticresistant. We provide evidence that α-tocopherol could be a useful therapeuticagent for individuals who are susceptible to infection with P. aeruginosa , suchas those who are immunocompromised or critically ill.

AB  - Diseases that occur during the transition period are exacerbated when cows areunable to cope with an increased pro-oxidant load that results in oxidativestress. Dairy cattle are routinely supplemented with the vitamin E analogα-tocopherol to mitigate the severity of oxidative stress. Nonetheless , oxidativestress remains a disease predisposing condition for many dairy cattle. A bettermethod of optimizing the antioxidant functions of vitamin E is needed.α-Tocopherol is only 1 of 8 analogs of vitamin E , all of which have varyingantioxidant properties in other mammals , albeit a shorter physiological half-lifecompared with α-tocopherol. A primary bovine mammary endothelial cell oxidantchallenge model was used to determine functions of certain vitamin E analogs. Theaim of this study was to determine if other analogs , namely γ-tocopherol orγ-tocotrienol , have antioxidative functions in bovine cells and if thesefunctions may protect cellular viability and endothelial function from oxidantdamage. Physiological (10 μM) and supraphysiological (50 μM) concentrations ofγ-tocopherol and γ-tocotrienol had a greater capacity to reduce accumulatedreactive oxygen species derived from a nitric oxide donating pro-oxidantantagonist , when compared with α-tocopherol , after 30 min to 6 h of treatment.Further , γ-tocotrienol (10 μM) decreased cell cytotoxicity to a greater amountthan other analogs at like concentrations , whereas γ-tocopherol (10 μM) reducedlipid peroxidation and apoptosis more effectively than other analogs. Last ,α-tocopherol (5 and 10 μM) and γ-tocopherol (5 and 10 μM) significantly slowedpro-oxidant induced loss of endothelial cell barrier integrity over a 48-h periodusing an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system. Concerningly ,γ-tocotrienol drastically reduced the endothelial barrier integrity at only 5 μMdespite no apparent effect on cellular viability at like concentrations.γ-Tocotrienol , however , was also the only analog to show significant cytotoxicityand reductions in viability at supraphysiological doses (25 and 50 μM). Ourresults suggest that γ-tocopherol has antioxidant activities that reducescellular damage and loss of function due to oxidant challenge as effectively asα-tocopherol. These data set the foundation for further investigation into theantioxidant properties of vitamin E analogs in other bovine cells types or wholeanimal models.

TI  - Metabolites , Nutrients , and Lifestyle Factors in Relation to Coffee Consumption:An Environment-Wide Association Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu12051470 [doi]
LID - 1470
AB  - Coffee consumption has been inversely associated with various diseases; however ,the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. We used data of 17,752 ThirdNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants to investigate theassociation of 245 metabolites , nutrients , and lifestyle factors with coffeeconsumption. We used data from the first phase (n = 8825) to identify factorswith a false discovery rate of <5%. We then replicated our results using datafrom the second phase (n = 8927). Regular coffee consumption was positivelyassociated with active and passive smoking , serum lead and urinary cadmiumconcentrations , dietary intake of potassium and magnesium , and aspirin intake. Incontrast , regular coffee consumption was inversely associated with serum folateand red blood cell folate levels , serum vitamin E and C , and beta-cryptoxanthinconcentrations , Healthy Eating Index score , and total serum bilirubin. Most ofthe aforementioned associations were also observed for caffeinated beverageintake. In our assessment of the association between coffee consumption andselected metabolites , nutrients , and lifestyle factors , we observed that regularcoffee and caffeinated beverage consumption was strongly associated with smoking ,serum lead levels , and poorer dietary habits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) has the highest global prevalence among allmalignancies in women and the second highest prevalence in the overallpopulation. Paclitaxel (PTX), a tricyclic diterpenoid , is effective against BC.However , its poor solubility in water and the allergenicity of its dissolutionmedium limited its clinical application. METHODS: In this work , we established amultifunctional graphene oxide (GO) tumor-targeting drug delivery system usingnanosized graphene oxide (nGO) modified with D-tocopherol polyethylene glycolsuccinate (TPGS) and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) for PTX loading.RESULTS: The obtained RGD-TPGS-nGO-PTX was 310.20±19.86 nm in size; thepolydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential were 0.21±0.020 and -23.42 mV ,respectively. The mean drug loading capacity of RGD-TPGS-nGO-PTX was 48.78%.RGD-TPGS-nGO-PTX showed satisfactory biocompatibility and biosafety and had nosignificant toxic effects on zebrafish embryos. Importantly , it exerted excellentcytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells , reversed multi-drug resistance (MDR) inMCF-7/ADR cells , and showed significant anti-tumor efficacy in tumor-bearing nudemice. CONCLUSION: These findings strongly suggested that the multifunctional GOtumor-targeting drug delivery system RGD-TPGS-nGO-PTX could be used in clinicalsettings to improve PTX delivery , reverse MDR and increase the therapeuticefficacy of BC treatment.

TI  - Identifying Predictors of Response to Vitamin E for the Treatment of PediatricNonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.
PG  - 1301-1307
LID - 10.1002/jpen.1766 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) respondto treatment with vitamin E. The characteristics of responders are not known. Theobjective of this study was to investigate the outcomes of vitamin E use inclinical practice and to determine factors associated with response to treatment.METHODS: A pediatric cohort with NASH treated with vitamin E for 6-24 months wasstudied retrospectively. Vitamin E response was defined as alanineaminotransferase (ALT) normalization or >50% ALT reduction from baseline.Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine thepredictors of response to vitamin E. Available paired liver biopsy data wereanalyzed to determine histologic response. RESULTS: Of the 151 childrenprescribed vitamin E , 73 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of those , 28 (38%)were vitamin E responders. Higher baseline serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)levels , steatosis grade , and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score(NAS) were associated with response to vitamin E (ALP: odds ratio [OR] , 14.1; 95%CI , 1.7-118.6; steatosis: OR 2.5; 95% CI , 1.2-5.0; NAS: OR 1.6; 95% CI , 1.1-2.4).In a multivariate logistic regression model , ALP and steatosis grade rendered anarea under the curve of 0.75 (P < .001) for the prediction of response totreatment. Ballooning , NAS , and portal inflammation improved significantly withvitamin E in the subcohort (n = 15) with paired liver biopsies. CONCLUSIONS:Vitamin E treatment was associated with significant ALT response in 38% ofchildren. Baseline serum ALP levels and steatosis grade were associated withresponse to treatment.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeuticapproaches of bone defect regeneration. A complication that is steadilyincreasing due to demographic population developments is an age-related disorderof the osteogenic differentiation potential (ODP) of MSCs. In the present invitro study we have evaluated the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) andantioxidants on ODP of "normal healthy" as well as osteogenetically compromisedhuman adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASC). We show that although ASCexhibit a marked ODP , a significant number of ASC cultures showed a retardedosteogenesis. These so-called "non-responder"-ASC cultures (NR-ASC) expressed anantigenic phenotype identical to that of the well osteogenically differentiating"responder"-ASCs (R-ASC) , but NR-ASC significantly correlated with the older ageof their donors as well as with a significantly higher intracellular generationof ROS. Furthermore , we found that treatment of the cell cultures with lowconcentration of H(2)O(2) seemed to promote osteogenic differentiation but higherH(2)O(2) concentration strongly reduced osteogenesis in all ASC cultures.Additionally , we found that exogenously applied superoxide dismutase (SOD) orcatalase completely restored the impaired ODP of NR-ASC , whereas ascorbate ,glutathione , N-acetylcysteine or a water soluble vitamin E derivate did not showany relevant effects. Our results suggest that aging-related increases inoxidative stress , especially due to H(2)O(2) , can severely impair the ODP of ASCwhereas SOD or catalase almost completely corrected this disorder. Our findingspoint to novel osteo-therapeutic aspects of catalase and SOD and open up newapproaches to ASC-based regeneration of bone defects.

TI  - Effect of vitamin E sources and inclusion levels in diets on growth performance ,meat quality , alpha-tocopherol retention , and intestinal inflammatory cytokineexpression in broiler chickens.

AB  - Water-miscible vitamin E (WVE) has been known to be more bioavailable thanconventional lipid-soluble vitamin E (LVE) in human foods because of its greatersolubility in the gastrointestinal tract. However , no data regarding thecomparison of the efficacy of WVE to LVE were available in poultry diets. Theobjective of the current experiment was to investigate the effect of vitamin E(VE) sources and inclusion levels in diets on growth performance , meat quality ,alpha-tocopherol retention , and intestinal inflammatory cytokine expression inbroiler chickens. A total of 420 6-d-old broiler chicks were allotted to 1 of 7dietary treatments with 6 replicates in a completely randomized design. Thecorn-soybean meal-based basal diet was formulated without inclusion ofsupplemental VE. Additional 6 diets were prepared by supplementing the basal dietwith either WVE or LVE at the inclusion levels of 33 , 65 , or 100 IU/kg in diets.Diets were fed to birds for 26 d. Results indicated that different VE sources andinclusion levels from 33 to 100 IU/kg in diets had no effects on growthperformance in broilers. The VE sources did not affect lipid oxidation in bothbreast and thigh meat. However , increasing inclusion levels of VE decreased(linear and quadratic , P < 0.05) lipid oxidation in breast meat. Regardless of VEsources , increasing inclusion levels of VE increased (linear , P < 0.01)alpha-tocopherol concentrations in breast meat. Dietary WVE showed a greaterreduction in the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes inthe jejunum than dietary LVE. Increasing inclusion levels of both VE sourcesdecreased (linear and quadratic , P < 0.05) the expression of both pro- andanti-inflammatory cytokine genes in the jejunum. The efficacy of dietary WVE forgrowth performance , meat quality , lipid oxidation , and alpha-tocopherol retentionin broilers chickens is similar to that of dietary LVE. However , it is likelythat dietary WVE is more effective in decreasing intestinal inflammatoryresponses than dietary LVE in broilers.

AB  - Regular consumption of fruits and vegetables , which is related to high plasmalevels of lipid-soluble micronutrients such as carotenoids and tocopherols , islinked to lower incidences of various age-related diseases. Differences inlipid-soluble micronutrient blood concentrations seem to be associated with age.Our retrospective analysis included men and women aged 22-37 and 60-85 years fromthe Berlin Aging Study II. Participants with simultaneously available plasmasamples and dietary data were included (n = 1973). Differences between young andold groups were found for plasma lycopene , α-carotene , α-tocopherol ,β-cryptoxanthin (only in women) , and γ-tocopherol (only in men). β-Carotene ,retinol and lutein/zeaxanthin did not differ between young and old participantsregardless of the sex. We found significant associations for lycopene , α-carotene(both inverse) , α-tocopherol , γ-tocopherol , and β-carotene (all positive) withage. Adjusting for BMI , smoking status , season , cholesterol and dietary intakeconfirmed these associations , except for β-carotene. These micronutrients areimportant antioxidants and associated with lower incidence of age-relateddiseases , therefore it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms inorder to implement dietary strategies for the prevention of age-related diseases.To explain the lower lycopene and α-carotene concentration in older subjects ,bioavailability studies in older participants are necessary.

PG  - 65-74
LID - 10.5114/ceh.2019.83159 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a challenginghealth problem. Hyperuricemia is a key player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Thisstudy investigated the effect of allopurinol (uric acid synthesis inhibitor) incombination with metformin and vitamin E in prevention of fructose induced-fattyliver in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats were divided into 7 groups: controlgroup , fructose group (model group of NAFLD) , allopurinol-treated group ,metformin-treated group , vitamin E-treated group , metformin plus vitaminE-treated group and a combination group (received allopurinol plus metformin plusvitamin E). Development of NAFLD was assessed biochemically by serum alanineaminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as well as byhistopathological examination. Oxidative stress parameters [reduced glutathione(GSH) , superoxide dismutase (SOD) , malondialdehyde (MDA)] , and the inflammatorymediators tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS) were assessed , along with serum levels of uric acid and triglyceride (TG).RESULTS: Combination of allopurinol plus metformin plus vitamin E significantlyattenuated fatty changes compared to their respective monotherapy. Interestingly ,though all treated groups showed significant attenuation in the oxidative stressmarkers , TNF-α level and iNOS immunostaining in hepatic tissue , along with asignificant decrease in the levels of uric acid and TG , the combination groupshowed a further significant decrease in the serum level of uric acid and iNOSimmunostaining compared to other treated regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Allopurinolsynergistically increases the protective effect of metformin and vitamin E intreatment of NAFLD , namely via reduction of uric acid synthesis and iNOSexpression.

AB  - Vitamins are the essential elements for human life and , particularly , for infanthealth. Human milk is the best source of nutrients for newborns , however , theinformation of vitamins in Asian maternal milk is still limited. In this study ,we have collected 580 Asian maternal milk samples from Korea (n = 254) , China (n= 137) , Pakistan (n = 92) , and Vietnam (n = 97). The vitamin concentrations ,including vitamin B-groups (8 vitamins) , fat-soluble vitamin (retinol , D , E , K)and lutein in the breast milk of were investigated. The concentration of thiamin(B(1)) , biotin (B(7)) , and folic acid (B(9)) in mother's milk of four countrieswere not considerably different , while riboflavin (B(2)) , pantothenic acid(B(5)) , and pyridoxine (B(6)) level in Vietnam samples were significantly lowerthan those in other countries. In contrast , retinol (A) and tocopherol (E) werefound to be higher levels in Vietnamese maternal milk. Korean and Chinesematernal milk had low concentrations of retinol that may cause vitamin Adeficiency in children. However , Chinese mother's milk was distinguished with ahigh concentration of lutein. Pakistani mother's milk was observed as having asignificant problem of folic acid (B(9)) deficiency. Regardless of the country ,vitamin B(12) , K , and D did not seem to be provided sufficiently through maternalmilk. The moderate positive correlations were found between vitaminconcentrations in each country and the pooled sample. The data obtained in thisstudy were able to provide vital information to assess the nutritional status ofbreast milk in Asian countries and contributed to the efforts of ensuring thebest nutrition for Asian children.

AB  - Feed ingredients and additives could be a potential medium for foreign animaldisease entry into the United States. The feed industry has taken active steps toreduce the risk of pathogen entry through ingredients. Medium chain fatty acid(MCFA) and heat pulse treatment could be an opportunity to prevent pathogencontamination. The objective of experiment 1 was to determine the impact of 0 ,30 , 60 , or 90 d storage time on fat-soluble vitamin stability when vitamin premix(VP) and vitamin trace mineral premix (VTM) were blended with 1% inclusion ofMCFA (1:1:1 blend of C6:C8:C10) or mineral oil (MO) with different environmentalconditions. Samples stored at room temperature (RT) (~22 °C) or in anenvironmentally controlled chamber set at 40 °C and 75% humidity ,high-temperature high humidity (HTHH). The sample bags were pulled out at days 0 ,30 , 60 and 90 for RT condition and HTHH condition. The objective of experiment 2was to determine the effect of heat pulse treatment and MCFA addition onfat-soluble vitamin stability with two premix types. A sample from each treatmentwas heated at 60 °C and 20% humidity. For experiment 1 , the following effectswere significant for vitamin A: premix type × storage condition (P = 0.031) andstorage time × storage condition (P = 0.002) interactions; for vitamin D3: maineffect of storage condition (P < 0.001) and storage time (P = 0.002); and forvitamin E: storage time × storage condition interaction (P < 0.001). Forexperiment 2 , oil type did not affect the stability of fat-soluble vitamins (P >0.732) except for vitamin A (P = 0.030). There were no differences forfat-soluble vitamin stability between VP and VTM (P > 0.074) except for vitamin E(P = 0.016). Therefore , the fat-soluble vitamins were stable when mixed with bothvitamin and VTM and stored at 22 °C with 28.4% relative humidity (RH). Whenpremixes were stored at 39.5 °C with 78.8%RH , the vitamin A and D(3) were stableup to 30 d while the vitamin E was stable up to 60 d. In addition , MCFA did notinfluence fat-soluble vitamin degradation during storage up to 90 d and in theheat pulse process. The vitamin stability was decreased by 5% to 10% after thepremixes was heated at 60 °C for approximately nine and a half hours. If bothchemical treatment (MCFA) and heat pulse treatment have similar efficiency atneutralizing or reducing the target pathogen , the process of chemical treatmentcould become a more practical practice.

TI  - Mitigating the Growth , Biochemical Changes , Genotoxic and Pathological Effects ofCopper Toxicity in Broiler Chickens by Supplementing Vitamins C and E.
LID - 10.3390/ani11061811 [doi]
LID - 1811
AB  - This experiment was carried out to explore the efficiency of an individual orcombined doses of vitamin C (Vit. C) and vitamin E (Vit. E) in alleviatingbiochemical , genotoxicity , and pathological changes in the liver induced bycopper sulfate (CuSO(4)) toxicity in broiler chickens. Two hundred andfifty-one-day-old broiler chicks were haphazardly allotted into five groups (fivereplicates/group , ten chicks/replicate). The birds were fed five experimentaldiets; (1) basal diet with no additives (CON) , (2) basal diets supplemented with300 mg CuSO(4)/kg diet (CuSO(4)) , (3) basal diets supplemented with 300 mgCuSO(4)/kg diet + 250 mg Vit. C /kg diet , (4) basal diets supplemented with 300mg CuSO(4)/kg diet +250 mg Vit. E /kg diet , (5) basal diets supplemented with 300mg CuSO(4)/kg diet + 250 mg Vit. C /kg diet + 250 mg Vit. E /kg diet for sixweeks. The results displayed that CuSO(4)-intoxicated birds had significantly (p< 0.05) decreased bodyweight , weight gain , and feed intake with increased feedconversion ratio from the 2nd week till the 6th week compared with the CON.However , these changes were minimized by single or combined supplementation ofvitamin C and E. The FCR was insignificantly different in birds-fed dietscomplemented with vitamin C and E singly or in combination from the 3rd week ofage compared to the CON. Serum aminotransferases (ALT , AST) and alkalinephosphatase (ALP) were elevated in CuSO(4)-intoxicated birds (p < 0.05).Additionally , they showed a drop in serum total protein (TP) , albumin , globulins ,triglycerides (TG) , total cholesterol (TC) , low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C) , very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) , and high-densitylipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels compared to the CON (p < 0.05).Concomitantly , histopathological and DNA changes were perceived in the liver ofCuSO(4)-intoxicated birds. Co-supplementation of Vit. C and Vit. Esingle-handedly or combined with CuSO(4)-intoxicated chickens enhanced theperformance traits and abovementioned changes , especially with those givencombinations of vitamins. From the extant inquiry , it could be established thatsupplementation of vitamin C and E was beneficial for mitigating the harmfuleffects of CuSO(4) toxicity on growth performance and liver histoarchitecture inbroiler chickens.

AB  - Amentoflavone (AMF) is a kind of biflavonoids existing in Ginkgo biloba leaves.It has many biological activities , such as antioxidant , anti-inflammatory ,anti-bacterial , antiviral , hypoglycemic , anti-tumor and inducing apoptosis.However , its solubility and bioavailability are poor and there are a few studieson it in vivo. In this study , to improve its solubility and bioavailability , thenanomicelles were prepared with TPGS and soluplus as carriers for the first time.The particle size , Zeta potential , encapsulation efficiency , drug loading ,stability , cytotoxicity , cellular uptake , and metabolites in rats were studied.Cytotoxicity , cellular uptake , and metabolites in rats of AMF-loadedTPGS/soluplus mixed micelles were compared with those of AMF. As a result ,AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles with a particle size of 67.33 ± 2.01 nmand Zeta potential of -0.84133 ± 0.041405 mV were successfully prepared. Theencapsulation efficiency and drug loading of the mixed nanomicelles were99.18 ± 0.76% and 2.47 ± 0.01% , respectively. The physical and chemicalproperties of the mixed micelles were stable within 60 d , and the cytotoxicity ofthe mixed micelles was much greater than that of AMF monomers. Thirty-four kindsof metabolites of AMF were identified in rats. The metabolites were mainlydistributed in rat feces. No metabolites were detected in bile and plasma. 14kinds of metabolites of the mixed micelles in rats were detected , including 11 infeces , 6 in urine , and 3 in plasma , which indicated that the bioavailability ofAMF has been improved. And the toxicity to cancer cells was enhanced , which laida foundation for the development of new drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of vitamin E in methotrexate- (MTX-) inducedtransaminitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A case-controlstudy was conducted at a tertiary rheumatology center for 12 months. Patientswith RA on MTX and deranged aminotransferases were included. Patients withprevious liver diseases , baseline transaminitis before methotrexate initiation ,alcohol intake , muscle diseases , under hepatotoxic drugs , and aminotransferases >3 times the upper normal limit were excluded. The patients were divided intotreatment (vitamin E 400 mg bid for 3 months) and control groups (no vitamin E)using a random number table. The dose of MTX was unaltered. Follow-up was doneafter 3 and 6 months. Independent t-test was done to compare means of two groups.Paired t-test was done to compare differences in mean. RESULTS: Among 230patients , 86.5% were female with a mean BMI of 25.9 ± 4.5 kg/m(2). In thetreatment group , SGPT and SGOT at baseline were 73.1 ± 20.4 and 60.2 ± 24.5 IU/L ,respectively; at 3-month follow-up 44.6 ± 34.2 and 38.3 ± 20.8 IU/L ,respectively; and at 6-month follow-up 40.4 ± 35.7 and 34.2 ± 21.9 IU/L ,respectively. In the control group , SGPT and SGOT at baseline were 63.4 ± 15.1and 46.8 ± 13.7 IU/L , respectively , and at 3-month follow-up 55.8 ± 45.9 and 45.5± 30.9 IU/L , respectively. Significant decrease in the level of aminotransferaseswas seen in the treatment group (p value < 0.001) and not in the control group (pvalues 0.161 and 0.728 , respectively). The change in levels of SGPT and SGOT frombaseline to 3 months of follow-up was statistically significant in between twostudy groups (p values 0.007 and <0.001 , respectively). From the control group ,29 patients were crossed over to vitamin E for the next 3 months. SGPT and SGOTdecreased from 97.6 ± 44.1 to 46.1 ± 40.9 and 69.3 ± 34.9 to 29.1 ± 11.6 IU/L ,respectively (p values 0.031 and 0.017 , respectively). CONCLUSION: Vitamin Esignificantly attenuates MTX-induced transaminitis.

TI  - Characterization and Cytotoxicity of Polyprenol Lipid and Vitamin E-TPGS HybridNanoparticles for Betulinic Acid and Low-Substituted Hydroxyl Fullerenol inMHCC97H and L02 Cells.
PG  - 2733-2749
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S249773 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study demonstrated an innovative formulation including thepolyprenol (GBP) lipid and vitamin E-TPGS hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) which wasaimed to control the transfer of betulinic acid (BA) and low-substituted hydroxylfullerenol (C(60)(OH)(n)). Additionally , it developed BA-C(60)(OH)n-GBP-TPGS-NPsdelivery system and researched the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) effects.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NPs were prepared by nanoprecipitation withultrasonic-assisted emulsification (UAE) method. It was characterized by scanningelectronic microscopy (SEM) , transmission electron microscopy (TEM) , FTIRspectrum , size distribution and zeta potential. Physical and chemical propertieswere evaluated through measurement of drug release , stability studies , drugloading efficiency (DE) and encapsulation efficiency (EE). Biological activitieswere evaluated through measurement of MTT assay , lactate dehydrogenase leakageassay (LDH) , cell proliferation assays , cell apoptosis analysis , comet assay ,wound healing assay , cell invasion and Western blot analysis. RESULTS ANDCONCLUSIONS: The NPs exhibited clear distribution characteristics , improvedsolubility and stability. BA and C(60)(OH)(n) for the NPs displayed a biphasicrelease pattern with sustained drug release properties. The mixture ofC(60)(OH)(n) with different hydroxyl groups may have a certain effect on thestability of the NPs system itself. The NPs could effectively inhibit MHCC97Hcell proliferation , migration and invasion in vitro. Combined use of C(60)(OH)(n)and BA in GBP lipids may improve the inhibit effect of C(60)(OH)(n) or BA againstHCC cells and reduce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of C(60)(OH)(n) for normalcells. We concluded that one of the important mechanisms ofBA-C(60)(OH)(n)-GBP-TPGS-NPs inhibiting MHCC97H cells is achieved byup-regulating the expression of Caspase-3 , Caspase-8 and Caspase-9.

PG  - 1247781

LID - 1247781
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tocotrienols and tocopherols , which are synthesized in plastids ofplant cells with similar functionalities , comprise vitamin E to serve as a potentlipid-soluble antioxidant in plants. The synthesis of tocopherols involves thecondensation of homogentisic acid (HGA) and phytyl diphosphate (PDP) under thecatalysis of homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT). Tocotrienol synthesis isinitiated by the condensation of HGA and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP)mediated by homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT). As one of the mostimportant oil crops , canola seed is regarded as an ideal plant to efficientlyimprove the production of vitamin E tocochromanols through genetic engineeringapproaches. However , only a modest increase in tocopherol content has beenachieved in canola seed to date. METHODS: In this study , we transformed barleyHGGT (HvHGGT) into canola to improve total tocochromanol content in canola seeds.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed that the total tocochromanol contentin the transgenic canola seeds could be maximally increased by fourfold relativeto that in wild-type canola seeds. Notably , no negative impact on importantagronomic traits was observed in transgenic canola plants , indicating greatapplication potential of the HvHGGT gene in enhancing tocochromanol content incanola in the future. Moreover , the oil extracted from the transgenic canolaseeds exhibited significantly enhanced oxidative stability under high temperaturein addition to the increase in total tocochromanol content , demonstratingmultiple desirable properties of HvHGGT.

TI  - Effect of vitamin E supplementation on bilirubin levels in infants withhyperbilirubinemia: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 249-256
LID - 10.3345/cep.2023.01312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of vitamin E supplementation on bilirubin levels ininfants was previously explored , but the results were inconclusive. PURPOSE: Toexamine the effect of vitamin E supplementation on bilirubin levels in terminfants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: This interventionaldouble-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Sanandaj BesatHospital NICU. Enrolled newborns were between 37 and 42 weeks and 6 days ofgestation and required phototherapy according to American Academy of Pediatricsclinical guidelines. A total of 138 infants were randomly assigned to vitamin E(n=68) or placebo (n=70) groups. In addition to phototherapy , the vitamin E groupreceived 0.5 mL (5 IU) of supplemental vitamin E daily , whereas the placebo groupreceived 0.5 mL of oral dextrose daily. STATA 17 was used for the data analysis.RESULTS: Changes in bilirubin levels at 24 hours postintervention did not differsignificantly from baseline in either group. Vitamin E supplementation did notsignificantly reduce total bilirubin levels at 24 hours postintervention (meandifference [MD] , -0.18; P=0.204; 95% confidence interval [CI] , -1.39 to 1.02).However , the vitamin E group exhibited lower total bilirubin levels than theplacebo group at 48 hours postintervention (MD , 0.18; P=0.365; 95% CI , -0.89 to1.27) and 72 hours (MD , 0.36; P=0.356; 95% CI , -2.34 to 1.61) , although thedifferences were not statistically significant. A subgroup analysis revealed thatfemale infants experienced a greater reduction in total bilirubin levels thanmale infants. CONCLUSION: Infants administered vitamin E versus placebodemonstrated similar reductions in bilirubin levels and hospital stays. Althoughthe average bilirubin changes did not differ significantly between groups , thevitamin E group showed a more noticeable reduction over time , indicating apositive effect of vitamin E supplementation on serum bilirubin reduction.

TI  - Effect of Fat-Soluble Vitamins A , D , E and K on Vitamin Status and MetabolicProfile in Patients with Fat Malabsorption with and without Urolithiasis.
LID - 10.3390/nu12103110 [doi]
LID - 3110
AB  - Patients with intestinal fat malabsorption and urolithiasis are particularly atrisk of acquiring fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. The aim of the study was toevaluate the vitamin status and metabolic profile before and after thesupplementation of fat-soluble vitamins A , D , E and K (ADEK) in 51 patients withfat malabsorption due to different intestinal diseases both with and withouturolithiasis. Anthropometric , clinical , blood and 24-h urinary parameters anddietary intake were assessed at baseline and after ADEK supplementation for twoweeks. At baseline , serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was higher instone formers (SF; n = 10) than in non-stone formers (NSF; n = 41) but decreasedsignificantly in SF patients after supplementation. Plasma vitamin D and Econcentrations increased significantly and to a similar extent in both groupsduring intervention. While plasma vitamin D concentrations did not differ betweenthe groups , vitamin E concentrations were significantly lower in the SF groupthan the NSF group before and after ADEK supplementation. Although vitamin Dconcentration increased significantly in both groups , urinary calcium excretionwas not affected by ADEK supplementation. The decline in plasma AST activity inpatients with urolithiasis might be attributed to the supplementation of ADEK.Patients with fat malabsorption may benefit from the supplementation offat-soluble vitamins ADEK.

TI  - Polycaprolactone-Vitamin E TPGS Micellar Formulation for Oral Delivery ofPaclitaxel.
LID - 10.3390/polym16152232 [doi]
LID - 2232
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the potential of polycaprolactone-vitamin E TPGS(PCL-TPGS) micelles as a delivery system for oral administration of paclitaxel(PTX). The PCL-TPGS copolymer was synthesized using ring opening polymerization ,and PTX-loaded PCL-TPGS micelles (PTX micelles) were prepared via a co-solventevaporation method. Characterization of these micelles included measurements ofsize , polydispersity , and encapsulation efficiency. The cellular uptake of PTXmicelles was evaluated in Caco-2 cells using rhodamine 123 (Rh123) as afluorescent probe. Moreover , an everted rat sac study was conducted to evaluatethe ex vivo permeability of PTX micelles. Additionally , a comparativepharmacokinetic study of PTX micelles versus the marketed formulation ,Ebetaxel(®) (a Taxol generic) , was performed after a single oral administrationto rats. The results demonstrated that the micellar formulation significantlyimproved PTX solubility (nearly 1 mg/mL). The in vitro stability and release ofPTX micelles in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid(SIF) demonstrated that PTX micelles remained stable for up to 24 h andsignificantly slowed the release of PTX in both media compared to Ebetaxel(®).The in vitro cellular uptake , ex vivo intestinal permeability , and in vivopharmacokinetic profile demonstrated that PTX micelles enhanced the permeabilityand facilitated a rapid absorption of the drug. Conclusively , thePCL(7000)-TPGS(3500) micelles exhibit potential as an effective oral deliverysystem for PTX.

TI  - Effect of Castor and Cashew Nut Shell Oils , Selenium and Vitamin E asAntioxidants on the Health and Meat Stability of Lambs Fed a High-ConcentrateDiet.
LID - 10.3390/antiox9121298 [doi]
LID - 1298
AB  - Functional oils are known for their compounds with antioxidant , antimicrobial andanti-inflammatory properties , and are used in ruminant nutrition as alternativesto chemicals in order to improve performance. This study aimed to compare theinfluence of castor and cashew nut shell oils with pure organic selenium(hydroxy-selenomethionine) plus vitamin E , which are known and well-stablishedantioxidants , on the performance traits , shelf life and microbial quality of themeat , physiological functions and oxidative stress control of lambs. Thirty-twoDorper x Santa Ines lambs (initial bodyweight of 22.42 ± 3.9 kg and 60 days ofage) were submitted to a diet consisting of Cynodon dactylon hay (6%) andconcentrate (94%). The animals were divided into four treatments: control ,without additives; functional oils (FO) , 0.50 g/kg DM of castor and cashew nutshell oils; hydroxy-selenomethionine and vitamin E (SeE) , 0.50 mg/kg of organicselenium and 100 IU/kg DM of vitamin E; FO plus SeE , at the same doses as theother groups. Blood samples were collected after 1 , 30 and 53 days on feed. After54 days , the lambs were slaughtered and rumen health , carcass and meat traits ,shelf life , and microbiological quality were evaluated. There were no differencesin performance or carcass traits. A higher muscle and serum Se concentration (p <0.0001) , lower lipid peroxidation in meat during display (p < 0.0001) , and alower count of psychrotrophic microorganisms on day 5 were observed in the SeEand FO plus SeE groups. The treatments reduced the counts of Enterobacteriaceae ,and Staphylococcus spp. FO animals showed higher GSH-Px activity on day 30 , whilethe peroxidase activity was higher in FO plus SeE animals (p = 0.035). SeE and FOplus SeE animals had lower serum ALT and AST levels. Functional oils improved themicrobiological quality of meat. Hydroxy-selenomethionine and vitamin E preventedoxidative stress , lipid peroxidation , and microbial spoilage.

TI  - Antioxidant Vitamin Intake and LOX-Index in Japanese Municipal Workers.
PG  - 36-43
LID - 10.3177/jnsv.70.36 [doi]
AB  - Antioxidant vitamin intake has been reported to be associated with decreased riskof cardiovascular diseases. To date , however , no study has examined theassociation between antioxidant vitamin intake and LOX-index , a predictivebiomarker of cardiovascular disease. We investigated the cross-sectionalassociation between antioxidant vitamin (α-carotene , β-carotene , α-tocopherol ,and vitamin C) intake and LOX-index in Japanese municipal workers. Participantswere 346 workers (171 men and 175 women aged 19-71 y) who received a healthcheck-up and participated in a nutrition and health survey. Antioxidant vitaminintake was assessed using a validated brief self-administered diet historyquestionnaire. LOX-index was calculated by multiplying serum concentrations ofthe soluble form of lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 by those of LOX-1 ligandscontaining apolipoprotein B. Multiple regression analysis was used to estimatethe geometric mean of LOX-index according to tertile of each antioxidant vitaminintake. Overall , α-carotene , β-carotene , α-tocopherol , and vitamin C intake werenot associated with LOX-index. However , in stratified analyses by sex , geometricmeans of LOX-index tended to decrease with antioxidant vitamin intake in women ,but not in men. The geometric means of LOX-index for the lowest through highesttertile of α-carotene intake were 771 (604-984) , 639 (511-799) , and 564 (469-677)(p for trend=0.07). Our results suggest that there is no association betweenantioxidant vitamin intake and LOX-index in Japanese workers. The suggestiveinverse association between antioxidant vitamin intake and LOX-index in womenwarrants further investigation.

TI  - Distribution of injected fat-soluble vitamins in plasma and tissues of nurserypigs.
PG  - 1985-1990
LID - 10.5713/ajas.19.0987 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects offat-soluble vitamin injection on plasma and tissue vitamin status in nurserypigs. METHODS: A total of 16 pigs (initial body weight: 7.15±1.1 kg) wereallotted to 2 treatments at d 7 post-weaning. Pigs were fed a corn-soybeanmeal-based basal diet with no supplemental vitamin A and i.m. injected with300,000 IU of retinyl palmitate , 900 IU of d-α-tocopherol and 30,000 IU ofvitamin D3 with control pigs having no vitamin injection. Blood (d 0 , 3 , 7 , and14 post-injection) and tissue samples (liver , brain , heart , lung , and muscle; d 7and 14 post-injection) were collected from pigs. Retinyl palmitate , retinol , andα-tocopherol concentrations were analyzed in plasma and tissues , while plasma wasassayed for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD3). RESULTS: Plasma retinol and25-OHD3 concentrations increased by the vitamin injection from d 3 to 14post-injection (p<0.05) whereas plasma retinyl palmitate was detected only in thevitamin treatment at d 3 and 7 post-injection (115.51 and 4.97 μg/mL ,respectively). Liver retinol , retinyl palmitate , and retinol+retinyl palmitateconcentrations increased by retinyl palmitate injection at d 7 and 14post-injection (p<0.05) whereas those were not detected in the other tissues. Thed-α-tocopherol injection increased α-tocopherol concentrations in plasma at d 3and 7 post-injection (p<0.05) and in liver , heart (p<0.10) , and muscle (p<0.05)at d 7 post-injection. CONCLUSION: Fat-soluble vitamin injection increased plasmastatus of α-tocopherol , retinol , retinyl palmitate and 25-OHD3. As plasma levelsdecreased post-injection , vitamin A level in liver and vitamin E level in muscle ,heart and liver increased. The α-tocopherol found in plasma after injection wasdistributed to various tissues but retinyl palmitate only to the liver.

TI  - Choline Intake as Supplement or as a Component of Eggs Increases Plasma Cholineand Reduces Interleukin-6 without Modifying Plasma Cholesterol in Participantswith Metabolic Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/nu12103120 [doi]
LID - 3120
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by low-grade inflammation and insulinresistance , which increase the risk of heart disease. Eggs have numerousnutrients including choline , carotenoids , and fat-soluble vitamins that mayprotect against these conditions. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a majorcontributor of dietary choline in the American diet. However , uncertainty remainsregarding eggs due to their high concentration of cholesterol. In this study , weevaluated the effect of two sources of choline , whole eggs (a source of PC) and acholine supplement (choline bitartrate , CB) , on plasma lipids , glucose , insulinresistance , and inflammatory biomarkers. We recruited 23 subjects with MetS toparticipate in this randomized cross-over intervention. After a 2-week washout ,with no choline intake , participants were randomly allocated to consume threeeggs/day or CB (~400 mg choline/d for both) for 4 weeks. After a 3-week washoutperiod , they were allocated to the alternate treatment. Dietary records indicatedhigher concentrations of vitamin E and selenium during the egg period (p < 0.01).Interestingly , there were no changes in plasma total , low density lipoprotein(LDL)- or high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol , triglycerides , or glucose ,compared either to baseline or between treatments. In contrast , interleukin-6 wasreduced , with both sources of choline compared to baseline , while eggs also hadan effect on lowering C-reactive protein , insulin , and insulin resistancecompared to baseline. This study demonstrates that in a MetS population , intakeof three eggs per day does not increase plasma LDL cholesterol , and hasadditional benefits on biomarkers of disease compared to a choline supplement ,possibly due to the presence of other antioxidants in eggs.

TI  - Fat-Soluble Vitamin Supplementation Using Liposomes , Cyclodextrins , orMedium-Chain Triglycerides in Cystic Fibrosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/nu13124554 [doi]
LID - 4554
AB  - Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency remains a challenge in cystic fibrosis (CF) ,chronic pancreatitis , and biliary atresia. Liposomes and cyclodextrins canenhance their bioavailability , thus this multi-center randomizedplacebo-controlled trial compared three-month supplementation of fat-solublevitamins in the form of liposomes or cyclodextrins to medium-chain triglycerides(MCT) in pancreatic-insufficient CF patients. The daily doses were as follows:2000 IU of retinyl palmitate , 4000 IU of vitamin D3 , 200 IU of RRR-α-tocopherol ,and 200 µg of vitamin K2 as menaquinone-7 , with vitamin E given in soybean oilinstead of liposomes. All participants received 4 mg of β-carotene and 1.07 mg ofvitamin K1 to ensure compliance with the guidelines. The primary outcome was thechange from the baseline of all-trans-retinol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3concentrations and the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin. Out of 75randomized patients (n = 28 liposomes , n = 22 cyclodextrins , and n = 25 MCT) , 67completed the trial (89%; n = 26 liposomes , n = 18 cyclodextrins , and n = 23 MCT)and had a median age of 22 years (IQR 19-28) , body mass index of 20.6 kg/m(2)[18.4-22.0] , and forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 65% (44-84%). The liposomalformulation of vitamin A was associated with the improved evolution of serumall-trans-retinol compared to the control (median +1.7 ng/mL (IQR -44.3-86.1) vs.-38.8 ng/mL (-71.2-6.8) , p = 0.028). Cyclodextrins enhanced the bioavailabilityof vitamin D3 (+9.0 ng/mL (1.0-17.0) vs. +3.0 ng/mL (-4.0-7.0) , p = 0.012) andvitamin E (+4.34 µg/mL (0.33-6.52) vs. -0.34 µg/mL (-1.71-2.15) , p = 0.010).Liposomes may augment the bioavailability of vitamin A and cyclodextrins maystrengthen the supplementation of vitamins D3 and E relative to MCT inpancreatic-insufficient CF but further studies are required to assess liposomalvitamin E (German Clinical Trial Register number DRKS00014295 , funded from EU andNorsa Pharma).

AB  - This study aimed to measure hemolysis before , during and after 60 days of theground-based spaceflight analog bed rest and the effect of a nutritionalintervention through a prospective randomized clinical trial. Twenty maleparticipants were hospitalized for 88 days comprised of 14 days of ambulatorybaseline , 60 days of 6° head-down tilt bed rest and 14 days of reambulation. Tenparticipants each received a control diet or daily polyphenol associated withomega-3 , vitamin E , and selenium supplements. The primary outcome was endogenouscarbon monoxide (CO) elimination measured by gas chromatography. Hemolysis wasalso measured with serial bilirubin , iron , transferrin saturation blood levelsand serial 3-day stool collections were used to measure urobilinoid excretionusing photometry. Total hemoglobin mass (tHb) was measured using CO-rebreathing.CO elimination increased after 5 , 11 , 30 , and 57 days of bed rest: +289 ppb (95%CI 101-477 ppb; p = 0.004) , +253 ppb (78-427 ppb; p = 0.007) , +193 ppb(89-298 ppb; p = 0.001) and +858 ppb (670-1046 ppb; p < 0.000) , respectively ,compared to baseline. Bilirubin increased after 20 and 49 days of bed rest+0.8 mg/l (p = 0.013) and +1.1 mg/l (p = 0.012) , respectively; and iron increasedafter 20 days of bed rest +10.5 µg/dl (p = 0.032). The nutritional interventiondid not change CO elimination. THb was lower after 60 days of bed rest -0.9 g/kg(p = 0.001). Bed rest enhanced hemolysis as measured through all threeby-products of heme oxygenase. Ongoing enhanced hemolysis over 60 dayscontributed to a 10% decrease in tHb mass. Modulation of red blood cell controltowards increased hemolysis may be an important mechanism causing anemia inastronauts.

TI  - Variation in Bioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Activity of Rubus Fruits atDifferent Developmental Stages.
LID - 10.3390/foods11081169 [doi]
LID - 1169
AB  - Blackberry and raspberry have high nutritional , health value , and are popularwith consumers for their unique flavors. To explore the relationships betweennutrient accumulation , antioxidant substance contents in blackberry and raspberryfruits , and fruit growth and development , seven Rubus cultivars were selected ,and contents of the main active substance were determined. "Clode Summit" had thehighest soluble sugar and fructose contents , "Chester"-the highest total phenolcontent , and "Bristol'-the highest anthocyanin content. Generally , the contentsof flavonoids and total phenols showed a downward trend with the development offruit in seven Rubus cultivars , and the content of anthocyanins increased rapidlyin the later stage of development. Pearson correlation analysis showed extremelysignificant correlation between antioxidant activity and the contents of vitaminE , total phenols , and flavonoids. Flavonoids were extremely significantlypositively correlated with the content of total phenols , and the contents offlavonoids and anthocyanins in various cultivars were highly negativelycorrelated. Considering the different nutritional ingredients and activeantioxidant substance contents , "Clode Summit" , "Bristol" , and "Chester" arerecommended for raw consumption , processing , and medicinal purposes ,respectively. These results provide a reference for comparing the main activesubstance contents in different Rubus cultivars and their changes across fruitdevelopment stages.

TI  - The interaction of silver(II) complexes with biological macromolecules andantioxidants.

AB  - Silver is widely used for its antimicrobial properties , but microbial resistanceto heavy metals is increasing. Silver(II) compounds are more oxidizing andtherefore have the potential to overcome resistance via extensive attack oncellular components , but have traditionally been hard to stabilize for biologicalapplications. Here , the high oxidation state cation was stabilised usingpyridinecarboxylate ligands , of which the 2,6-dicarboxypyridine Ag(II) complex(Ag2,6P) was found to have the best tractability. This complex was found to bemore stable in phosphate buffer than DMSO , allowing studies of its interactionwith water soluble antioxidants and biological macromolecules , with the aim ofdemonstrating its potential to oxidize them , as well as determining the reactionproducts. Spectrophotometric analysis showed that Ag2,6P was rapidly reduced bythe antioxidants glutathione , ascorbic acid and vitamin E; the unsaturated lipidsarachidonic and linoleic acids , model carbohydrate β-cyclodextrin , and proteincytochrome c also reacted readily. Analysis of the reaction with glutathione byNMR and electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed that the glutathione wasoxidized to the disulfide form. Mass spectrometry also clearly showed theaddition of multiple oxygen atoms to the unsaturated fatty acids , suggesting aradical mechanism , and cross-linking of linoleic acid was observed. The sevenhydroxyl groups of β-cyclodextrin were found to be completely oxidized to thecorresponding carboxylates. Treatment of cytochrome c with Ag2,6P led to proteinaggregation and fragmentation , and dose-dependent oxidative damage wasdemonstrated by oxyblotting. Thus Ag2,6P was found to be highly oxidizing to awide variety of polar and nonpolar biological molecules.

TI  - Overall and Sex-Specific Associations of Serum Lipid-Soluble Micronutrients withMetabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease among Adults in theUnited States.
LID - 10.3390/nu16081242 [doi]
LID - 1242
AB  - This study examined overall and sex-specific associations of serum lipid-solublemicronutrients including α- and γ-tocopherols , 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) ,retinol , and six major carotenoids with metabolic dysfunction-associatedsteatotic lever disease (MASLD) using the 2017-2018 National Health and NutritionExamination Survey. This analysis included 3956 adults (1991 men , 1965 women)aged ≥ 20 years. Steatotic liver disease was determined through transientelastography examination. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for MASLD associated with micronutrients were estimated using logisticregressions. Higher serum α-tocopherol (highest vs. lowest quartile: OR = 1.53 ,95% CI = 1.05-2.22 , p = 0.03) and γ-tocopherol (highest vs. lowest quartile: OR =4.15 , 95% CI = 3.00-5.74 , p < 0.0001) levels were associated with increased oddsof MASLD. Higher serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with reduced odds of MASLD(highest vs. lowest quartile: OR = 0.41 , 95% CI = 0.27-0.61 , p = 0.0001). Inverseassociations with the condition were also observed for carotenoids (α-carotene ,β-carotene , α-cryptoxanthin , β-cryptoxanthin , combined lutein and zeaxanthin , andlycopene) in the serum (Ps < 0.05). The results were comparable between men andwomen , except for those on α-tocopherol , for which a positive association wasonly observed for men (p = 0.01). Our results suggest potential protectiveassociations of serum 25(OH)D and carotenoids with MASLD. The positiveassociations between tocopherols and MASLD may reflect pathophysiologicalconditions associated with the condition.

TI  - Encapsulation of Vitamins A and E as Spray-Dried Additives for the Feed Industry.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25061357 [doi]
LID - 1357
AB  - Encapsulated fat-soluble powders containing vitamin A (VA) and E (VE) wereprepared as a feasible additive for extruded feed products. The effect of theencapsulating agents (Capsul-CAP(®) , sodium caseinate-SC) in combination withTween 80 (TW) as an emulsifier and maltodextrin (MD) as a wall material on thephysicochemical properties of emulsions and powders was evaluated. First ,nanoemulsions containing MD:CAP:TW:VA/VE and MD:SC:TW:VA/VE were prepared andcharacterized. Then , powders were obtained by means of spray-drying and analyzedin terms of the product yield , encapsulation efficiency , moisture content ,porosity , surface morphology , chemical structure , and thermal properties andthermo-oxidative/thermal stability. Results showed that although nanoemulsionswere obtained for all the compositions , homogeneous microcapsules were foundafter the drying process. High product yield and encapsulation efficiency wereobtained , and the presence of the vitamins was corroborated. The characteristicsof the powders were mainly influenced by the encapsulating agent used and also bythe type of vitamin. In general , the microcapsules remained thermally stable upto 170 °C and , therefore , the proposed encapsulation systems for vitamins A and Ewere suitable for the preparation of additives for the feed manufacturing throughthe extrusion process.

TI  - Oxidative Stress and Cerebral Vascular Tone: The Role of Reactive Oxygen andNitrogen Species.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25053007 [doi]
LID - 3007
AB  - The brain's unique characteristics make it exceptionally susceptible to oxidativestress , which arises from an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS)production , reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production , and antioxidant defensemechanisms. This review explores the factors contributing to the brain's vasculartone's vulnerability in the presence of oxidative damage , which can be ofclinical interest in critically ill patients or those presenting acute braininjuries. The brain's high metabolic rate and inefficient electron transportchain in mitochondria lead to significant ROS generation. Moreover ,non-replicating neuronal cells and low repair capacity increase susceptibility tooxidative insult. ROS can influence cerebral vascular tone and permeability ,potentially impacting cerebral autoregulation. Different ROS species , includingsuperoxide and hydrogen peroxide , exhibit vasodilatory or vasoconstrictiveeffects on cerebral blood vessels. RNS , particularly NO and peroxynitrite , alsoexert vasoactive effects. This review further investigates the neuroprotectiveeffects of antioxidants , including superoxide dismutase (SOD) , vitamin C , vitaminE , and the glutathione redox system. Various studies suggest that theseantioxidants could be used as adjunct therapies to protect the cerebral vasculartone under conditions of high oxidative stress. Nevertheless , more extensiveresearch is required to comprehensively grasp the relationship between oxidativestress and cerebrovascular tone , and explore the potential benefits ofantioxidants as adjunctive therapies in critical illnesses and acute braininjuries.

TI  - A Quantitative Re-Assessment of Microencapsulation in (Pre-Treated) Yeast.
LID - 10.3390/molecules29020539 [doi]
LID - 539
AB  - Most hydrophobes easily diffuse into yeast cells , where they experience reducedevaporation and protection from oxidation , thus allowing inherently biocompatibleencapsulation processes. Despite a long-standing industrial interest , the effectof parameters such as how is yeast pre-treated (extraction with ethanol ,plasmolysis with hypertonic NaCl , depletion to cell walls) , the polarity of thehydrophobes and the process conditions are still not fully understood. Here , wehave developed thorough analytical protocols to assess how the effects of theabove on S. cerevisiae's morphology , permeability , and encapsulation efficiency ,using three differently polar hydrophobes (linalool , 1,6-dihydrocarvone ,limonene) and three separate processes (hydrophobes as pure 'oils' , waterdispersions , or acetone solutions). The harsher the pre-treatment (depleted >plasmolyzed/extracted > untreated cells) , the easier the diffusion into yeastbecame , and the lower both encapsulation efficiency and protection fromevaporation , possibly due to denaturation/removal of lipid-associated (membrane)proteins. More hydrophobic terpenes performed worst in encapsulation as pure'oils' or in water dispersion , but much less of a difference existed in acetone.This indicates the specific advantage of solvents/dispersants for 'difficult'compounds , which was confirmed by principal component analysis; furthering thisconcept , we have used combinations of hydrophobes (e.g. , linalool andα-tocopherol) , with one acting as solvent/enhancer for the other. Our resultsthus indicate advantages in using untreated yeast and-if necessary-processesbased on solvents/secondary hydrophobes.

AB  - Crossbred beef heifers (n = 23; initial body weight [BW] = 370 ± 12 kg) housed atthe North Dakota State University Beef Cattle Research Complex in Fargo , ND , wereused to evaluate the effects of a 250-d slow-release vitamin and mineral bolus onfeedlot performance , feeding behavior , carcass characteristics , and liver mineralconcentrations. Heifers were assigned to one of two treatments: 1) received nosupplemental mineral or vitamin (CON , n = 12) or 2) received two boluses on day 0(minimum of 3,740 mg Ca , 16,456 mg Mg , 112 mg Na , 11,220 mg Cu , 2,995 mg I , 2,805mg Mn , 505 mg Se , 48,620 mg Zn , 468 mg Co , 824,296 IU vitamin A , 173,102 IUvitamin D3 , and 4,121 IU vitamin E bases on company analysis; Reloader 250Mineral Bolus , Cargill Inc. , Minneapolis , MN; MIN , n = 11). Heifers were fed atotal mixed ration containing corn silage , grass hay , dried distillers grainswith solubles , and dry-rolled corn (16.05% crude protein , 1.44 Mcal/kg NEg) withno added vitamin or mineral supplement. Feed intake and number and time of visitswere recorded for each heifer using the Insentec feeding system (Hokofarm GroupB.V. , the Netherlands) during the feeding period. Liver biopsies were collectedfrom heifers on days 0 , 69 , and 134 of the feeding period for analysis of mineralconcentrations and analyzed as repeated measures. Heifers were slaughtered after150 or 169 d on feed , and carcass characteristics were determined. Final BW ,average daily gain , dry matter index , gain:feed , and carcass characteristics werenot influenced (P > 0.19) by treatment. Control heifers visited feeders more butspent less time per visit and ate less per visit compared with MIN heifers (P <0.03). No differences (P > 0.06) in liver mineral concentrations were observedbetween treatments , and concentrations of Se , Cu , Mo , Mn , and Co decreased (P <0.05) over the feeding period. In this experiment , the slow-release vitamin andmineral bolus evaluated failed to increase liver mineral concentrations duringthe finishing period or influence heifer performance and carcass characteristics.

AB  - Introduction: PNPLA3 , TM6SF2 , and MBOAT7 genes play a crucial role innon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development and worsening. However , fewdata are available on their treatment response influence. The aim of this trialis to explore the effect derived from silybin-phospholipids complex (303 mg ofsilybin-phospholipids complex , 10 μg of vitamin D , and 15 mg of vitamin E twice aday for 6 months) oral administration in NAFLD patients carrying PNPLA3-rs738409 ,TM6SF2-rs58542926 , or MBOAT7-rs641738 genetic variants. Materials and Methods: Inall , 92 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients were grouped in 30 NAFLD wild type controls ,30 wild type treated patients , and 32 mutated treated ones. We assessed glycemia(FPG) , insulinemia , HOMA-IR , aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST , ALT) ,C-reactive protein (CRP) , thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) ,stiffness , controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) , dietary daily intake , andphysical activity at baseline and end of treatment. Results: The wild-typetreated group showed a significant improvement of FPG , insulinemia , HOMA-IR , ALT ,CRP , and TBARS (p < 0.05) , whereas no improvements were recorded in the other twostudy groups. NAFLD wild type treated patients showed higher possibilities ofuseful therapeutic outcome (p < 0.01) , obtained from the prescribed therapeuticregimen , independently from age , sex , comorbidities , medications , CAP , andstiffness in comparison to the mutated group. Discussion: The assessed mutationsare independently associated with no response to a silybin-based therapeuticregimen and could be considered as useful predictive markers in this context.Clinical Trial Registry Number: www.ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier: NCT04640324.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the levels of fat-soluble vitamins A , D , and E inchildren with obesity and their influencing factors. METHODS: A total of 273children with obesity who attended the Department of Clinical Nutrition , Xi'anChildren's Hospital , from January 2019 to April 2021 were enrolled as the obesitygroup. A total of 226 children with normal body weight who underwent physicalexamination during the same period were enrolled as the control group.Anthropometric parameters and body composition were measured for both groups , andthe serum concentrations of vitamins A , D , and E were also measured. RESULTS:Compared with the control group , the obesity group had significantly higher serumlevels of vitamin A [(1.32±0.21) μmol/L vs (1.16±0.21) μmol/L , P<0.001] andvitamin E [(9.3±1.4) mg/L vs (8.3±1.2) mg/L , P<0.001] and a significant reductionin the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [(49±22) nmol/L vs (62±24) nmol/L , P<0.001].In the obesity group , the prevalence rates of marginal vitamin A deficiency ,vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency , and vitamin E insufficiency were 5.5%(15/273) , 56.8% (155/273) , and 4.0% (11/273) , respectively. After adjustment forbody mass index Z-score and waist-to-height ratio , serum vitamin A level waspositively correlated with age (P<0.001) , while vitamins E and 25-hydroxyvitaminD levels were negatively correlated with age in children with obesity (P<0.001).After adjustment for age , the serum levels of vitamin A , vitamin E and25-hydroxyvitamin D were not correlated with degree of obesity , percentage ofbody fat , and duration of obesity in children with obesity , while the serumlevels of vitamins A and E were positively correlated with waist-to-height ratio(P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are higher serum levels of vitamins A and E inchildren with obesity , especially in those with abdominal obesity , while serumvitamin D nutritional status is poor and worsens with age. Therefore , vitamin Dnutritional status should be taken seriously for children with obesity , andvitamin D supplementation should be performed when necessary.

AB  - Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and reduces the level of reactive oxygen species(ROS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alpha-tocopherol (ATF) is the most widelystudied form of vitamin E besides gamma-tocopherol (GTF) which also showsbeneficial effects in AD. The levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and amyloid precursorprotein (APP) increased in the brains of AD patients , and mutations in the APPgene are known to enhance the production of Aβ. Mitochondrial function was shownto be affected by the increased level of Aβ and may induce cell death. Here , weaimed to compare the effects of ATF and GTF on their ability to reduce Aβ level ,modulate mitochondrial function and reduce the apoptosis marker in SH-SY5Y cellsstably transfected with the wild-type or mutant form of the APP gene. The Aβlevel was measured by ELISA , the mitochondrial ROS and ATP level were quantifiedby fluorescence and luciferase assay respectively whereas the complex V enzymeactivity was measured by spectrophotometry. The expressions of genes involved inthe regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability such as voltage dependentanion channel (VDAC1) , adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) , and cyclophilin D(CYPD) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) , while the expressions of cyclophilin D (CypD) , cytochrome c , Bcl2associated X (BAX) , B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) , and pro-caspase-3 were determinedby western blot. Our results showed that mitochondrial ROS level was elevatedaccompanied by decreased ATP level and complex V enzyme activity in SH-SY5Y cellsexpressing the mutant APP gene (p < 0.05). Treatment with both ATF and GTFreduced the mitochondrial ROS level with maximum reduction was observed in thecells treated with high concentrations of ATF and GTF (p < 0.05). However , onlyGTF at 80 µM significantly increase the ATP level and complex V enzyme activity(p < 0.05). VDAC1 and CYPD were downregulated and CypD protein was significantlyoverexpressed in cells transfected with the wild-type (WT) and mutant APP gene(p < 0.05). Cytochrome c release , the ratio of BAX/Bcl-2 , and pro-caspase-3expression increased in cells expressing mutated APP gene (p < 0.05). Theexpression of CypD and pro-caspase 3 protein , and the ratio of BAX/Bcl-2 wereincreased in the following order; SH-SY5Y-APP-WT < SH-SY5Y-APP Swe <SH-SY5Y-APPSwe/Ind. Treatment with both ATF and GTF reduced the release of cytochrome c andthe ratio of BAX/Bcl-2. However , only GTF significantly reduced the expression ofCypD and pro-caspase-3 , suggestive of its unique role in AD. In conclusion , GTFhas an effect that was not shown by ATF and thus suggest its potential role inthe development of therapeutic agents for AD.

TI  - Depletion and enrichment of phytosterols in soybean oil lipid emulsions directlyassociate with serum markers of cholestasis in preterm parenteral nutrition-fedpigs.
PG  - 160-171
LID - 10.1002/jpen.2088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical reports show a positive correlation between phytosterolconcentrations and severity of cholestatic liver disease markers in infantsduring long-term administration of parenteral lipid emulsions. Establishing acausal link between phytosterols and cholestasis has been complicated byconfounding factors of lipid emulsion load , fatty acid composition , and vitamin Ein many of these studies. The goal of this study is to determine whether alteringthe phytosterol concentration within a common soybean oil-based emulsion willalter the onset and severity of cholestasis in parenterally fed preterm piglets.METHODS: Preterm piglets were administered , for 21 days , either enteral nutrition(ENT) or parenteral nutrition (PN) prepared from a soybean oil-based emulsioncontaining either 24.0% (depleted [DEP]) , 100% (Intralipid; normal phytosterol[NP] concentration) , or 144% (enriched [ENR]) total phytosterol concentration.RESULTS: At the end of the study , plasma and liver phytosterol concentrationswere highest in the ENR group , followed by NP and then DEP and ENT. Serum directbilirubin , serum bile acids , and γ-glutamyltransferase were higher in the ENR andNP groups compared with either DEP or ENT groups. All PN lipid groups showedevidence of mild hepatic steatosis but no change in hepatic expression ofproinflammatory cytokines or Farnesoid X receptor target genes. CONCLUSION: Theincrease in serum direct bilirubin was lower in the DEP group vs the lipidemulsions with normal or ENR phytosterols. Our results provide additionalevidence that phytosterols are linked to an increase in serum markers ofcholestasis in preterm PN-fed pigs.

AB  - Few prospective studies have evaluated the relation between fat-soluble vitaminsand glioma risk. Using three cohorts-UK Biobank (UKB) , Nurses' Health Study(NHS) , and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) , we investigatedassociations of pre-diagnostic concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins D , A , and Ewith incident glioma. In 346,785 participants (444 cases) in UKB , associationswith vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]) were evaluated by Cox proportionalhazards regression. In NHS (52 cases , 104 controls) and HPFS (32 cases , 64controls) , associations with 25(OH)D , vitamin A (retinol) , and vitamin E (α- andγ-tocopherol) were assessed using conditional logistic regression. Our resultssuggested plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D and retinol were not associated withglioma risk. Comparing the highest to lowest tertile , the multivariable hazardratio (MVHR) for 25(OH)D was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.11) in UKBand the multivariable risk ratio (MVRR) was 0.97 (95% CI 0.51-1.85) in NHS andHPFS. In NHS and HPFS , the MVRR for the same comparison for retinol was 1.16 (95%CI 0.56-2.38). Nonsignificant associations were observed for α-tocopherol(MVRR(tertile3vs1) = 0.61 , 95% CI 0.29-1.32) and γ-tocopherol (MVRR(tertile3vs1) = 1.30 , 95% CI 0.63-2.69) that became stronger in 4-year laggedanalyses. Further investigation is warranted on a potential association betweenα- and γ-tocopherol and glioma risk.

AB  - Recently , increasing attention has been paid to quantum mechanical behavior inbiology. In this study , we investigated the involvement of quantum mechanicaltunneling in the hydrogen-transfer reaction from Trolox , a water-soluble analogof vitamin E (α-tocopherol) , to 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH(•))in a phosphate buffer solution (0.05 M , pH 7.0). DPPH(•) was used as a reactivitymodel of reactive oxygen species and solubilized in water using β-cyclodextrin(β-CD). The second-order rate constants , k(H) and k(D) , in 0.05 M phosphatebuffer solutions prepared with H(2)O (pH 7.0) and D(2)O (pD 7.0) , respectively ,were determined for the reaction between Trolox and DPPH(•) , using a stopped-flowtechnique at various temperatures (283-303 K). Large kinetic isotope effects(KIE , k(H)/k(D)) were observed for the hydrogen-transfer reaction from Trolox tothe β-CD-solubilized DPPH(•) in the whole temperature range. The isotopic ratioof the Arrhenius prefactor (A(H)/A(D) = 0.003) , as well as the isotopicdifference in the activation energies (19 kJ mol(-1)) , indicated that quantummechanical tunneling plays a role in the reaction.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Despite availability of diagnostic and management referenceguidelines outlining standard of care for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liverdisease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) , national and regionalguidelines are lacking , resulting in variations in patient management betweenregions. We retrospectively analyzed patient characteristics and management datafrom the Adelphi Real World NASH Disease Specific Programme™ for patients withNASH in the EU5 , Canada , and the Middle East to identify gaps between real-worldpractice and that advocated by reference guidelines , irrespective of clinicianawareness or consultation of guidelines. METHODS: We performed an analysis ofphysicians (hepatologists , gastroenterologists , diabetologists) and theirpatients diagnosed with NASH. Physicians completed patient record forms for thenext 5 consulting patients , collecting information on patient care , includingdiagnosis and disease management. RESULTS: A total of 429 physicians provideddata for 2,267 patients with NASH (EU5 , n = 1,844; Canada , n = 130; Middle East ,n = 293). Patient age , physician-defined fibrosis stage , comorbidities andsymptoms , and diagnostic testing practices highlighted statistically significantdifferences across regions. Substantial disconnects between reference guidelinesand real-world practice were observed. Use of liver function tests , non-invasivetests (e.g. ultrasound and transient elastography) , and tests to exclude otherconditions was suboptimal. Although lifestyle advice was widely provided ,patients were less commonly referred to diet , exercise , and lifestylespecialists. Two-thirds of patients were receiving off-label treatment for NASHor associated underlying conditions with the aim of improving NASH , most commonlystatins , metformin , and vitamin E. CONCLUSION: Real-world NASH managementapproaches differ across regions and from proposed standard of care representedby reference multidisciplinary guidelines. Establishment and awareness of , andadherence to regional and national guidelines may improve identification andmanagement of patients with NASH and potentially improve outcomes in thispopulation. LAY SUMMARY: Although reference guidelines are available to guide themanagement of patients with NASH , these are not widely used and there is a lackof national guidelines. Our study shows how clinical practice in the EU , Canada ,and Middle East differs from proposed standard of care , particularly relating tohow patients are diagnosed and treated. Wider establishment of , awareness of , andreference to guidelines may improve how physicians identify and manage patientswith NASH.

TI  - Selenium Status and Hemolysis in Sickle Cell Disease Patients.
LID - 10.3390/nu11092211 [doi]
LID - 2211
AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy characterized by chronichemolysis. Chronic hemolysis is promoted by increased oxidative stress. Ourhypothesis was that some antioxidant micronutrients (retinol , tocopherol ,selenium , and zinc) would be determinant factors of the degree of hemolysis inSCD patients. We aimed to investigate the nutritional adequacy of theseantioxidants and their relationships to hemolysis. The study included 51 adultSCD patients regularly assisted in two reference centers for hematology in theState of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. Serum concentrations of retinol ,alpha-tocopherol , selenium , and zinc were determined by high-performance liquidchromatography or atomic absorption spectrometry. Hematological parameters(complete blood count , reticulocyte count , hemoglobin , direct and indirectbilirubin , total bilirubin , lactate dehydrogenase) and inflammation markers(leukocytes and ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein) were analyzed. A linearregression model was used to test the associations between the variables. Mostpatients presented selenium deficiency and low selenium consumption. Linearregression analysis showed that selenium is the main determinant of hemolysisamong the antioxidant nutrients analyzed. Thus , data from this study suggest thatthe nutritional care protocols for patients with SCD should include dietarysources of selenium in order to reduce the risk of hemolysis.

TI  - Assessing aging impact on growth potential of Vitamin E primed soybean seeds viabiochemical profiling.
PG  - 3717-3726
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2022.03.013 [doi]
AB  - Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a high value crop owing to its nutrient richprofile , consisting of some of the largest reserve of proteins and oils among allplant crops. High yielding soybean variety seeds are of great intrinsic value aspart of strategies to gain larger yield outputs over the years. These seeds oftentend to lose their viability and corresponding storage period. The study isprimarily focused on understanding and estimating the impact of storageconditions and influence of biochemical changes that leads to deteriorating seedhealth. Vitamin E is an essential compound that provides shielding effect toplant seeds against environmental stress. For this purpose seed priming ofvitamin E was performed with a concentration of 300mgL(-1) applied on to seeds. Atotal of seven promising cultivars were accessed for this; including Swat-20 ,Swat-84 , NARC-2. Malakand , Rawal , Ajmeri and FaisalSoy. Results shows that allcultivars tend to lose their yield potential which is greatly in line withstorage induced biochemical changes. Among the cultivars , Swat-84 and Swat-20were resilient to an extent towards harmful storage stress impact. The presentstudy has shown that application of vitamin E seed coating tend to enhancepositive traits in stored seeds (including concentrations of CAT , SOD , TSS , etc.)in comparison to untreated seeds showing a healthy impact of the treatment onseed health under storage conditions. It is suggested that storing vitamin Etreated seeds under optimum conditions as an effective method for attainingviable seeds after long terms storage. Findings of the present study can be usedfor future studies , assessment and designing of seed storage system in a mannerto reduce negative impact on seed growth potential during long term storages.

TI  - Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Common Questions and Answers on Diagnosis andManagement.
PG  - 603-612
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver diseasein the United States , affecting up to 30% of adults. There are two forms ofNAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) , defined as 5% or greater hepaticsteatosis without hepatocellular injury or fibrosis , and nonalcoholicsteatohepatitis (NASH) , defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis plushepatocellular injury and inflammation , with or without fibrosis. Individualswith obesity are at highest risk of NAFLD. Other established risk factors includemetabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although NAFLD is common andtypically asymptomatic , screening is not currently recommended , even in high-riskpatients. NAFLD should be suspected in patients with elevated liver enzymes orhepatic steatosis on abdominal imaging that are found incidentally. Once othercauses , such as excessive alcohol use and hepatotoxic medications , are excludedin these patients , risk scores or elastography tests can be used to identifythose who are likely to have fibrosis that will progress to cirrhosis. Liverbiopsy should be considered for patients at increased risk of fibrosis and whenother liver disorders cannot be excluded with noninvasive tests. Weight lossthrough diet and exercise is the primary treatment for NAFLD. Other treatments ,such as bariatric surgery , vitamin E supplements , and pharmacologic therapy withthiazolidinediones or glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues , have shown potentialbenefit; however , data are limited , and these therapies are not consideredroutine treatments. NAFL typically follows an indolent course , whereas patientswith NASH are at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease , cancer , andend-stage liver disease.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Capparis spinosa fruit ,quercetin and vitamin E on monosodium glutamate-induced toxicity in rats.
PG  - 127-134
LID - 10.30466/vrf.2018.83041.2091 [doi]
AB  - Capparis spinosa L. has many biological effects such as antioxidant properties.In the present study , we compared the effects of the hydro-alcoholic extract ofCapparis spinosa fruit , quercetin (Q) , and vitamin E (Vit E) on monosodiumglutamate (MSG)-induced toxicity. The following groups were designed: Controlgroups (normal saline and/or corn oil); MSG group (4.00 g kg(-1) MSG); MSG + lowdose extract group (4.00 g kg(-1) MSG with 100.00 mg kg(-1) extract); MSG + highdose extract (HDE) group (4.00 g kg(-1) MSG with 300.00 mg kg(-1) extract); MSG +Q group (4.00 g kg(-1) MSG with 10.00 mg kg(-1) Q); MSG + Vit E group (4.00 gkg(-1) MSG with 200.00 mg kg(-1) Vit E). All chemicals were orally administeredfor 14 consecutive days. Tissue specimens from the heart , kidney , and livertissues and blood samples were collected for histopathological and biochemicalevaluations. The results showed that the MSG-induced tissue edema , congestion ,and inflammatory cell infiltration were resolved by HDE , Q , and Vit E treatments.These chemicals also restored tissue malondialdehyde level and superoxidedismutase activity. Besides , alterations induced by MSG in serum levels ofaspartate transaminase , alanine aminotransferase , urea , lactate dehydrogenase ,and creatine kinase-MB were also resolved. It is concluded that Capparis spinosafruit extract , Q and Vit E can produce approximately similar protective effectson tissue function through oxidative stress alleviation and antioxidantmechanisms restoration.

TI  - Improvement of Imiquimod Solubilization and Skin Retention via TPGS Micelles:Exploiting the Co-Solubilizing Effect of Oleic Acid.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13091476 [doi]
LID - 1476
AB  - Imiquimod (IMQ) is an immunostimulant drug approved for the topical treatment ofactinic keratosis , external genital-perianal warts as well as superficial basalcell carcinoma that is used off-label for the treatment of different forms ofskin cancers , including some malignant melanocytic proliferations such as lentigomaligna , atypical nevi and other in situ melanoma-related diseases. Imiquimodskin delivery has proven to be a real challenge due to its very lowwater-solubility and reduced skin penetration capacity. The aim of the work wasto improve the drug solubility and skin retention using micelles ofd-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) , a water-solublederivative of vitamin E , co-encapsulating various lipophilic compounds with thepotential ability to improve imiquimod affinity for the micellar core , and thusits loading into the nanocarrier. The formulations were characterized in terms ofparticle size , zeta potential and stability over time and micelles performance onthe skin was evaluated through the quantification of imiquimod retention in theskin layers and the visualization of a micelle-loaded fluorescent dye bytwo-photon microscopy. The results showed that imiquimod solubility strictlydepends on the nature and concentration of the co-encapsulated compounds. Themicellar formulation based on TPGS and oleic acid was identified as the mostinteresting in terms of both drug solubility (which was increased from few µg/mLto 1154.01 ± 112.78 µg/mL) and micellar stability (which was evaluated up to 6months from micelles preparation). The delivery efficiency after the applicationof this formulation alone or incorporated in hydrogels showed to be 42- and25-folds higher than the one of the commercial creams.

TI  - Identification of a New Variety of Avocados (Persea Americana Mill. CV. Bacon)with High Vitamin E and Impact of Cold Storage on Tocochromanols Composition.
LID - 10.3390/antiox9050403 [doi]
LID - 403
AB  - (1) Background: Tocochromanols are a group of fat-soluble compounds includingvitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and plastochromanol-8 , and just oneavocado can contain up to 20% of the required vitamin E daily intake. (2)Methods: HPLC and LC-MS/MS analyses were performed in avocados of variousvarieties and origin for the identification and quantification of tocopherols ,tocotrienols and plastochromanol-8. After selection of the variety with thehighest vitamin E content , we evaluated to what extent short- (4 h) and long-term(10 d) cold storage influences the accumulation of tocochromanols. (3) Results:Analyses revealed that "Bacon" avocados (Persea americana Mill. cv. Bacon) werethe richest in vitamin E compared to other avocado varieties (including thehighly commercialized Hass variety) , and they not only accumulated tocopherols(with 110 µg of a-tocopherol per g dry matter) , but also tocotrienols (mostly inthe form of g-tocotrienol , with 3 µg per g dry matter) and plastochromanol-8 (4.5µg per g dry matter). While short-term cold shock did not negatively influencea-tocopherol contents , it increased those of g-tocopherol , g-tocotrienol , andplastochromanol-8 and decreased those of d-tocotrienol. Furthermore , storage ofBacon avocados for 10d led to a 20% decrease in the contents of a-tocopherol ,whereas the contents of other tocopherols , tocotrienols and plastochromanol-8were not affected. (4) Conclusions: It is concluded that Bacon avocados (i) arevery rich in a-tocopherol , (ii) not only contain tocopherols , but alsotocotrienols and plastochromanol-8 , and (iii) their nutritional vitamin E valueis negatively influenced by long-term cold storage.

AB  - The developing field of bio-nanotechnology aims to advance colloidal research viathe introduction of multifunctional nanoparticles to augment the dermaleffectiveness of active substances. Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems(SEDDS)-isotropic mixtures of oils , surfactants , solvents and co-solvents orsurfactants-are attracting interest in the cosmeceutical field. As part of thisstudy , SEDDS systems containing vitamin C or vitamin E and curcumin weredeveloped , whereby the bioavailability of the active compounds increased byenhancing their permeability to deeper layers of the skin. A compositionconsisting of 50% surfactin from Bacillus subtilis , 30% Transcutol and 20% oilphase was designed to encapsulate the active substances , i.e. , vitamin C orvitamin E and curcumin , contained in the oil phase. The developed carriers werecharacterized by average particle sizes of 69-183 nm. The formulations with thevitamins were found to be physically and chemically stable for 6 months.Transdermal tests were carried out , showing that the carriers enable thetransport of active substances deep into the skin , stopping at the dermis border.The formulations with vitamin C and vitamin E reduced the discoloration , thevascular lesions , and the depth of the wrinkles on the tested skin , which can beuseful in cosmetics in the treatment of problem skin , including capillary andsensitive skin.

AB  - Fast and easy tests for quantifying fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E andvitamin A , as well as β-carotene , in whole blood without a need to preprocessblood samples could facilitate assessment of the vitamin status of dairy cattle.The objective of this study was to validate a field-portablefluorometer/spectrophotometer assay for the rapid quantification of thesevitamins in whole blood and plasma of dairy cows and calves. We measured theconcentrations of vitamin E and β-carotene in whole blood and plasma from 28dairy cows and 11 calves using the iCheck test (BioAnalyt GmbH , Teltow , Germany)and compared the results with the current analytical standard (HPLC) in 2independent laboratories , one at the University of Potsdam (Germany) and at oneat DSM Nutritional Products Ltd. (Kaiseraugst , Switzerland). For vitamin A , theHPLC measurements were done only in the laboratory in Germany. The whole-bloodconcentrations of vitamin E as determined by iCheck (blood-hematocrit-corrected)ranged from 1.82 to 4.99 mg/L in dairy cows and 0.34 to 3.40 mg/L in calves.These findings were moderately correlated (R(2) = 0.66) with the values assessedby HPLC in dairy cattle (cows + calves). When calves were excluded , thecorrelation was higher (R(2) = 0.961). The β-carotene and vitamin A valuesobtained by the reference method HPLC were highly correlated with the iCheckmethods in whole blood (R(2) = 0.99 and 0.88 , respectively). In plasma , weobserved strong correlations between the concentrations assessed by iCheck andthose of HPLC for vitamin E (R(2) = 0.97) , β-carotene (R(2) = 0.98) , and vitaminA (R(2) = 0.92) in dairy cattle (cows + calves). For vitamin E , β-carotene , andvitamin A , we compared the relationship between the differences obtained by theiCheck assay and the HPLC measurements , as well as the magnitude of measurements ,using Bland-Altman plots to test for systematic bias. For all 3 vitamins , thedifferences values were not outside the 95% acceptability limits; we found nosystematic error between the 2 methods for all 3 analytes.

TI  - Effects of pH and Temperature on Water under Pressurized Conditions in theExtraction of Nutraceuticals from Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) Mushroom.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10081322 [doi]
LID - 1322
AB  - Currently , there is increased interest in finding appropriate food-grade greenextraction systems capable of extracting these bioactive compounds from dietarymushrooms for applications in various food , pharmacological , or nutraceuticalformulations. Herein , we evaluated a modified Swiss water process (SWP) methodusing alkaline and acidic pH at low and high temperature under pressurizedconditions as a suitable green food grade solvent to obtained extracts enrichedwith myco-nutrients (dietary phenolics , total antioxidants (TAA) , vitamins , andminerals) from Chaga. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled tohigh resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRAMS-MS/MS) wasused to assess the phenolic compounds and vitamin levels in the extracts , whileinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine themineral contents. Over 20 phenolic compounds were quantitatively evaluated in theextracts and the highest total phenolic content (TPC) and total antioxidantactivity (TAA) was observed at pH 11.5 at 100 °C. The most abundant phenoliccompounds present in Chaga extracts included phenolic acids such asprotocatechuic acid 4-glucoside (0.7-1.08 µg/mL) , syringic acid (0.62-1.18µg/mL) , and myricetin (0.68-1.3 µg/mL). Vitamins are being reported for the firsttime in Chaga. Not only , a strong correlation was found for TPC with TAA (r-0.8 ,<0.0001) , but also , with individual phenolics (i.e. , Salicylic acid) , lipophilicantioxidant activity (LAA) , and total antioxidant minerals (TAM). pH 2.5 at 100°C treatment shows superior effects in extracting the B vitamins whereas pH 2.5at 60 and 100 °C treatments were outstanding for extraction of total fat-solublevitamins. Vitamin E content was the highest for the fat-soluble vitamins in theChaga extract under acidic pH (2.5) and high temp. (100 °C) and ranges between 50to 175 µg/100 g Chaga. Antioxidant minerals ranged from 85.94 µg/g (pH7 at 100°C) to 113.86 µg/g DW (pH2.5 at 100 °C). High temperature 100 °C and a pH of 2.5or 9.5. The treatment of pH 11.5 at 100 °C was the most useful for recoveringphenolics and antioxidants from Chaga including several phenolic compoundsreported for the first time in Chaga. SWP is being proposed herein for the firsttime as a novel , green food-grade solvent system for the extraction ofmyco-nutrients from Chaga and have potential applications as a suitable approachto extract nutrients from other matrices. Chaga extracts enriched with bioactivemyconutrients and antioxidants may be suitable for further use or applications inthe food and nutraceutical industries.

TI  - Ubisol-Q(10) , a Nanomicellar and Water-Dispersible Formulation of Coenzyme-Q(10)as a Potential Treatment for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease.

LID - 764
AB  - The world continues a desperate search for therapies that could bring hope andrelief to millions suffering from progressive neurodegenerative diseases such asAlzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD). With oxidative stress thought to be a corestressor , interests have long been focused on applying redox therapies includingcoenzyme-Q(10). Therapeutic use has failed to show efficacy in human clinicaltrials due to poor bioavailability of this lipophilic compound. A nanomicellar ,water-dispersible formulation of coenzyme-Q(10) , Ubisol-Q(10) , has been developedby combining coenzyme-Q(10) with an amphiphilic , self-emulsifying molecule ofpolyoxyethanyl α-tocopheryl sebacate (derivatized vitamin E). This discovery madepossible , for the first time , a proper assessment of the true therapeutic valueof coenzyme-Q(10). Micromolar concentrations of Ubisol-Q(10) show unprecedentedneuroprotection against neurotoxin exposure in in vitro and in vivo models ofneurodegeneration and was extremely effective when delivered either prior to , atthe time of , and most significantly , post-neurotoxin exposure. These findingsindicate a possible way forward for clinical development due to effective doseswell within Federal Drug Administration guidelines. Ubisol-Q(10) is a potentmobilizer of astroglia , antioxidant , senescence preventer , autophagy activator ,anti-inflammatory , and mitochondrial stabilizer. Here we summarize the work withoil-soluble coenzyme-Q(10) , its limitations , and focus mainly on efficacy ofwater-soluble coenzyme-Q(10) in neurodegeneration.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: NAFLD is a growing health concern. The aim of the Fatty LiverAssessment in Germany (FLAG) study was to assess disease burden and provide dataon the standard of care from secondary care. METHODS: The FLAG study is anobservational real-world study in patients with NAFLD enrolled at 13 centresacross Germany. Severity of disease was assessed by non-invasive surrogate scoresand data recorded at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: In this study , 507 patients(mean age 53 years; 47% women) were enrolled. According to fibrosis-4 index , 64% ,26% , and 10% of the patients had no significant fibrosis , indeterminate stage ,and advanced fibrosis , respectively. Patients with advanced fibrosis were older ,had higher waist circumferences , and higher aspartate aminotransferase andgamma-glutamyltransferase as well as ferritin levels. The prevalence of obesity ,arterial hypertension , and type 2 diabetes increased with fibrosis stages.Standard of care included physical exercise >2 times per week in 17% (nosignificant fibrosis) , 19% (indeterminate) , and 6% (advanced fibrosis) ofpatients. Medication with either vitamin E , silymarin , or ursodeoxycholic acidwas reported in 5%. Approximately 25% of the patients received nutritionalcounselling. According to the FibroScan-AST score , 17% of patients presented withprogressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (n = 107). On follow-up at year 1 (n =117) , weight loss occurred in 47% of patients , of whom 17% lost more than 5% ofbody weight. In the weight loss group , alanine aminotransferase activities werereduced by 20%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on NAFLD from asecondary-care real-world cohort in Germany. Every 10th patient presented withadvanced fibrosis at baseline. Management consisted of best supportive care andlifestyle recommendations. The data highlight the urgent need for systematichealth agenda in NAFLD patients. LAY SUMMARY: FLAG is a real-world cohort studythat examined the liver disease burden in secondary and tertiary care. Herein ,10% of patients referred to secondary care for NAFLD exhibited advanced liverdisease , whilst 64% had no significant liver scarring. These findings underlinethe urgent need to define patient referral pathways for suspected liver disease.

TI  - The role of vitamin E in polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis and alleviatingendoplasmic reticulum stress in sub-adult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).
PG  - 275-287
LID - 10.1016/j.aninu.2023.09.008 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin E (VE) is an essential lipid-soluble vitamin that improves the fish fleshquality. However , the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This studyaimed to investigate the effects of VE on growth performance and flesh quality insub-adult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 450 fish(713.53 ± 1.50 g) were randomly divided into six treatment groups (threereplicates per treatment) and fed for nine weeks with different experimentaldiets (dietary lipid 47.8 g/kg) that contained different levels of VE (5.44 ,52.07 , 96.85 , 141.71 , 185.66 , and 230.12 mg/kg diet , supplemented asdl-α-tocopherol acetate). Notably , the treatment groups that were fed withdietary VE ranging from 52.07 to 230.12 mg/kg diet showed improvement in thepercent weight gain , special growth rate , and feed efficiency of grass carp.Moreover , the treatment groups supplemented with dietary VE level of 141.71 ,185.66 , and 230.12 mg/kg diet showed enhancement in crude protein , lipid , andα-tocopherol contents in the muscle , and the dietary levels of VE ranging from52.07 to 141.71 mg/kg diet improved muscle pH(24h) and shear force but reducedmuscle cooking loss in grass carp. Furthermore , appropriate levels of VE (52.07to 96.85 mg/kg diet) increased the muscle polyunsaturated fatty acid content ingrass carp. Dietary VE also increased the mRNA levels of fatty acidsynthesis-related genes , including fas , scd-1 , fad , elovl , srebp1 , pparγ , andlxrα , and up-regulated the expression of SREBP-1 protein. However , dietary VEdecreased the expression of fatty acid decomposition-related genes , includinghsl , cpt1 , acox1 , and pparα , and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes ,including perk , ire1 , atf6 , eif2α , atf4 , xbp1 , chop , and grp78 , anddown-regulated the expression of p-PERK , p-IRE1 , ATF6 , and GRP78 proteins. Inconclusion , dietary VE increased muscle fatty acid synthesis , which may be partlyassociated with the alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum stress , and ultimatelyimproves fish flesh quality. Moreover , the VE requirements for sub-adult grasscarp (713.53 to 1590.40 g) were estimated to be 124.9 and 122.73 mg/kg diet basedon percentage weight gain and muscle shear force , respectively.

TI  - Effect of Drying Temperatures on the Peanut Quality during Hot Air Drying.
PG  - 403-412
LID - 10.5650/jos.ess19249 [doi]
AB  - Peanuts are usually with high moisture after harvest and must be dried to preventmildew. Hot air drying is the most commonly used method for peanut drying. Thepurpose of this study was to evaluate the drying temperatures on the peanutqualities. In this paper , fresh peanuts were dried with solar radiation (controlgroup) and hot air at 35-60°C until the moisture content of peanut reduced below10%. The physical (texture , damaged percentage of red testa and breakagepercentage of peanut kernel) , physiological (germination) and biochemical (thecontents of vitamin E and aflatoxin B(1); acidity values , iodine values , peroxidevalues and fatty acid composition of peanut oil; solubility , emulsifying ,foaming , water-holding capacity and oil-binding capacity of peanut protein)properties of peanut kernel were determined under different drying conditions(solar radiation , 35°C , 40°C , 45°C , 50°C , 55°C , 60°C). The results showed thathot air temperatures had obvious influences on peanut qualities. The damagedpercentage of red testa and breakage percentage of peanut kernel increasedremarkably when the drying temperatures were above 45°C. Meanwhile , when dryingtemperatures were more than 45°C , the acid value and peroxide value of theextracted oil increased significantly. Furthermore , some properties exhibitedprominent changes when the temperatures were higher than 50°C , such as hardness ,brittleness , germination percentage , and the Vitamin E content of peanut kernel.In addition , the research results revealed that hot air can increasehydrophobicity of peanut protein and affect the functional properties of peanutprotein. Therefore , it could be concluded that peanut should be dried by hot airbelow 45°C for quality maintenance. It also provided reference to choose suitabledrying temperatures based on the final use of peanut.

TI  - Atrazine Toxicity: The Possible Role of Natural Products for Effective Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/plants12122278 [doi]
LID - 2278
AB  - There are various herbicides which were used in the agriculture industry.Atrazine (ATZ) is a chlorinated triazine herbicide that consists of a ringstructure , known as the triazine ring , along with a chlorine atom and fivenitrogen atoms. ATZ is a water-soluble herbicide , which makes it capable ofeasily infiltrating into majority of the aquatic ecosystems. There are reports oftoxic effects of ATZ on different systems of the body but , unfortunately ,majority of these scientific reports were documented in animals. The herbicidewas reported to enter the body through various routes. The toxicity of theherbicide can cause deleterious effects on the respiratory , reproductive ,endocrine , central nervous system , gastrointestinal , and urinary systems of thehuman body. Alarmingly , few studies in industrial workers showed ATZ exposureleading to cancer. We embarked on the present review to discuss the mechanism ofaction of ATZ toxicity for which there is no specific antidote or drug.Evidence-based published literature on the effective use of natural products suchas lycopene , curcumin , Panax ginseng , Spirulina platensis , Fucoidans , vitamin C ,soyabeans , quercetin , L-carnitine , Telfairia occidentalis , vitamin E , Garciniakola , melatonin , selenium , Isatis indigotica , polyphenols , Acacia nilotica , andZingiber officinale were discussed in detail. In the absence of any particularallopathic drug , the present review may open the doors for future drug designinvolving the natural products and their active compounds.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Advancement in cancer therapy has improvedsurvival among patients. However , use of anticancer drugs like anthracyclines(e.g. , doxorubicin) is not without adverse effects. Notable among adverse effectsof doxorubicin (DOX) is cardiotoxicity , which ranges from mild transient bloodpressure changes to potentially serious heart failure. Anecdotal reports suggestthat Kalanchoe integra (KI) may have cardio-protective potential. AIMS OF THESTUDY: This study sought to determine the cardio-protective potential of KIagainst doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and also examined any possiblegenotoxic potential of KI in selected organs. Additionally , the nitric oxidemodulatory potential of KI was assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves of KIwere collected , air-dried , pulverised and extracted using 70% ethanol.High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting was done for KI.Also , the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet assay) was employed toascertain the genotoxic potential of KI. In assessment of cardio-protectivepotential of KI against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity , a total of 42 femaleSprague-Dawley rats were put into 7 groups (n = 6). Group I: vehicle control ,received normal saline (1 mL/kg p.o) for 30 days. Group II: toxic control ,received DOX (20 mg/kg i.p.) once on the 29th day. Group III: KI control ,received KI (300 mg/kg p.o) for 30 days. Group IV: vitamin E control , receivedvitamin E (100 mg/kg p.o) for 30 days. Group V: KI treated-1 , received KI(300 mg/kg p.o) for 30 days and DOX (20 mg/kg i.p) on the 29th day. Group VI: KItreated-2 , received KI (600 mg/kg p.o) for 30 days and DOX (20 mg/kg i.p) on the29th day. Group VII: vitamin E treated , received vitamin E (100 mg/kg p.o) for 30days and DOX (20 mg/kg i.p) on the 29th day. Thirty-six (36) hours after lastadministration , rats were sacrificed. Blood samples were taken via cardiacpuncture to determine levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) , alaninetransaminase (ALT) , alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , creatine kinase (CK) , lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) , enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) , superoxidedismutase (SOD) , and catalase (CAT). Nitric oxide level was also determined.Hearts of rats in each group were excised and taken through histopathologicalexamination. RESULTS: In the HPLC fingerprint analysis , 13 peaks were identified ,and peak with retention time of 24.0 min had the highest peak area (3.223 x104mAU). Comet assay showed that the KI extract was non-genotoxic. Pretreatment withKI protected rats against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as evidenced by thelow levels of AST , ALT , ALP , CK and LDH compared with the controls (p < 0.05).SOD , CAT and GPX levels were also high for rats administered KI extracts , furthershowing that KI protected rats against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. KIalso inhibited nitric oxide levels at 300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg effective doses.Histological examination revealed that rats pretreated with KI showed no signs ofabnormal myocardial fibres (shape , size and configuration). CONCLUSION: Ethanolic(70%) leaf extract of KI showed no genotoxic potential and possessedcardioprotective effects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity inSprague-Dawley rats. KI also inhibited nitric oxide production , thus , a potentialnitric oxide scavenger.

AB  - Spent hemp biomass (SHB) , a byproduct of cannabinoid extraction from theproduction of industrial hemp has not been approved by FDA-CVM since its effectson animal health , performance , and product quality are unknown. Our objective wasto investigate the effects of feeding two levels of SHB and a 4-wk withdrawalperiod on performance , carcass characteristic , meat quality , and hematologicalparameters in finishing lambs. A total of 35 weaned , Polypay male lambs kept insingle pens were randomly assigned to five feeding treatments (n = 7) and feddiets containing either no SHB (CON) or SHB at 10% (LH1) or 20% (HH1) for 4 wkwith 4 wk of clearing period from SHB , or SHB at 10% (LH2) or 20% (HH2) for 8 wk.Chemical analysis revealed SHB to have a nutritive quality similar to alfalfawith no mycotoxin , terpenes , or organic residuals as a result of the extractionprocess. Feed intake of lambs was negatively affected by 20% SHB in period 1 butnot in period 2 where feed intake was the greatest in HH1 and LH2. In contrast ,none of the performance data , including liveweight gains , were different acrossthe groups and periods. In period 1 , blood glucose , cholesterol , calcium ,paraoxonase , and tocopherol were decreased by the level of SHB fed , whilebilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were increased. In period 2 , theconcentration in blood of urea , magnesium , bilirubin , ALP , and ferric reducingability of the plasma (FRAP) were higher in LH2 and HH2 as compared with CON ,while β-hydroxybutyrate was lower in HH2. Blood parameters related to liverhealth , kidney function , immune status , and inflammation were unaffected byfeeding SHB. Most carcass and meat quality parameters did not differ acrossfeeding groups either. Except carcass purge loss and meat cook loss were largerin lambs that were fed 20% SHB. Although lower feed intake of lambs that were fed20% SHB initially in period 1 suggested SHB was not palatable to the lambs ,increased feed intake at a lower level of inclusion at 10% in period 2 may pointto a positive long-term effect of feeding SHB.

OAB - The use of hemp by-products in livestock diets holds promise for reducing feedcosts and achieving greater resource-use efficiency through integration oflivestock production and rapidly growing hemp farming. Spent hemp biomass (SHB) ,the byproduct of the extraction process of cannabidiol from hemp can potentiallybe included in the ruminant diets due to its desirable nutritional properties.However , the potential accumulation of tetrahydrocannabinol—a psychotropiccompound in animal tissues and its effect on animal health , production , andproduct quality are still unknown. Therefore , we conducted an indoor feedingstudy to investigate the effects of varying levels of SHB and a withdrawal periodon feed intake , performance , health , and meat quality of lambs at Oregon StateUniversity. Our findings indicated that SHB can be included in lamb diets withoutcausing any major detrimental effects on performance , meat quality , or health ofthe lambs.

LID - 10.5187/jast.2021.e99 [doi]
AB  - The experiment was designed as a 3 × 3 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments ,including (i) pomegranate peel (zero , 4% , and 8 percent) , (ii) oxidized soybeanoil (zero , 2% , and 4 percent) , and (iii) alpha-tocopherol (zero and 200 mg/kg).Supplementation of 8% pomegranate peel in diets significantly decreased thegrowth performance of broiler chickens. The supplementation of 4% oxidized oil indiets significantly reduced body weight gain and Feed intake whole experimentalperiod (p < 0.05). The results showed that supplementation of 4% pomegranate peelin the diet was associated with low aspartate transaminase (AST) , alaninetransaminase , and malondialdehyde (MDA). However , 4% pomegranate peel increasedthe total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) andglutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. The supplemental 4% oxidized oilincreased the serum AST , alanine aminotransferase (ALT) , and MDA concentrations.TAC , SOD , and Catalase (CAT) activities were affected by 4% oxidized oil andalpha-tocopherol. The use of oxidized oil and vitamin E decreased MDAconcentration. The serum glucose and globulin concentrations were significantlylower in the 8% pomegranate peel. The results showed that supplementation with 4%pomegranate peel in diets reduced serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Theinclusion of 4% oxidized oil in diets reduced serum glucose and increased theblood lipid concentration such as triglyceride , cholesterol and LDL. Vitamin Esupplementation reduced the serum cholesterol and LDL concentrations. The use of8% pomegranate peel reduced red blood cell (RBC) , hemoglobin , and packed cellvalue (PCV). The results indicated that supplementation with 8% pomegranate peeland 4% oxidized oil in diets decreased the immunoglobulin concentration inbroilers. In addition , it was found that the inclusion of 4% pomegranate peel indiets resulted in higher IgG , IgM and total immunoglobulin. Pomegranate peelsupplementation significantly decreased meat MDA concentration. Supplementationof 4% oxidized oil increased MDA of meat (p < 0.05). Vitamin E supplementation(200 mg/kg) significantly decreased MDA of meat (p < 0.05). Consequently , theresults of this experiment showed that supplementation with 4% pomegranate peelhad beneficial effects on broiler chickens. It was also found that feeding 2%oxidized oil in diets had no adverse effect on broilers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate oxidant/antioxidant status in 21Holstein dairy cows with metritis compared to 8 healthy controls. Blood sampleswere taken during the first 21 days postpartum. Malondialdehyde (MDA) , a markerof oxidative stress , total antioxidant status (TAS) and antioxidant parameterssuch as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) , selenium (Se) , vitamins A and E andbeta-carotene were determined from all cows. The differences inbeta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) , non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) , calcium , bilirubinconcentrations and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity were also monitored ,as were milk production and milk composition. Metritis was defined by anunpleasant discharge of varying color (milky-grey/brown/sanguineous) andconsistency (muco-purulent/purulent/watery) and by the presence of increasedtemperature (> 38.5 °C) in cows within 21 days postpartum. Rectal examinationrevealed increased uterine size , thickened uterine wall and increased uterinetone. The affected cows had significantly reduced daily milk production.Additionally , hematological parameters and haptoglobin concentration were alsomeasured in metritic cows. RESULTS: Higher MDA concentration (P <  0.001) wasrecorded in cows with metritis , while vitamin A and vitamin E concentrations werelower (P <  0.01) compared to healthy cows. Higher BHB (P <  0.05) , NEFA(P <  0.05) , AST (P <  0.05) and bilirubin (P <  0.001) concentrations wasrecorded in cows with metritis as compared to the control group. Significantdifferences in beta-carotene concentration , GPx activity , and Se , TAS and Caconcentrations in cows with metritis compared to control group were not observedin the present study (P >  0.05). Milk production was decreased in the cows withmetritis (P <  0.001) and alterations in milk composition were also observed inmetritic cows as compared to healthy cows. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the studyshowed that cows with metritis in early postpartum are exposed to a higher degreeof oxidative stress and that the incidence of metritis can negatively affect milkproduction in dairy cows.

PG  - 6281-6295
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S326629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ziyuglycoside I (ZgI) , an active ingredient isolated from traditionalChinese medicine Sanguisorba officinalis L , has been demonstrated to increase theleucocytes and protect hematopoietic stem cells. However , the poor solubility anda short half-life of ZgI limit its bioavailability and efficacy. TheD-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) has been widely used toincrease the solubility , improve the encapsulation rate , and extend the half-lifeof drugs. METHODS: Here , we formulated the TPGS-modified long-circulatingliposomes loading ZgI with a sustained drug release and enhanced therapy formyelosuppression. ZgI-TPGS-liposomes were manufactured using a thin-filmhydration technique , followed by characterizations of physicochemical properties ,including the particle size , zeta potential , TEM , SEM , FTIR , XRD , stability , drugloading (DL) , encapsulation efficiency (EE). The in vitro and in vivo deliveryefficiency were further evaluated by cellular uptake , in vitro drug release andin vivo pharmacokinetics. Finally , therapeutic effect on myelosuppression wasinvestigated. RESULTS: The ZgI-TPGS-liposomes had an particle size of 97.89 ±1.42 nm and ZP of -28.65 ± 0.16 mV. It exhibited DL of 9.06 ± 0.76% and EE of92.34 ± 3.83% , along with excellent storage stability , cellular uptake andsustained drug release to free ZgI and liposomes without TPGS. Additionally , theTPGS modified liposomes significantly enhanced the therapeutic effect of ZgI onCTX induced myelosuppression , which can be confirmed in the apoptosis inhibitionand cell viability promotion of CTX injured HSPC-1 cells. Also , the mice in vivopharmacodynamics demonstrated that TPGS liposomes promoted ZgI increasing thenumbers of leucocytes and neutrophils in myelosuppression mice induced by CTX.CONCLUSION: Our research suggest that TPGS-modified long-circulating liposomesloading ziyuglycoside I has potential application in myelosuppression therapy.

TI  - Vitamin B6 efficacy in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: anopen-label , single-arm , single-center trial.
PG  - 181-186
LID - 10.3164/jcbn.20-142 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin B6 is an important cofactor in fat metabolism and its deficiency has beencorrelated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However , no study hasinvestigated the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation in these patients. Theaim of this open-label , single-arm , single-center study was to examine thetherapeutic effect of vitamin B6 in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liverdisease. Twenty-two patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease receivedvitamin B6 (90 mg/day) orally for 12 weeks. Clinical parameters were evaluated ,and liver fat and fibrosis were quantified before and after treatment usingmagnetic resonance imaging-based proton density fat fraction and magneticresonance elastography. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels , the primaryendpoint , did not change significantly after vitamin B6 treatment (93.6 ± 46.9 to93.9 ± 46.6 , p = 0.976). On the other hand , magnetic resonance imaging-basedproton density fat fraction , a parameter of hepatic lipid accumulation , wassignificantly reduced (18.7 ± 6.1 to 16.4 ± 6.4 , p<0.001) despite no significantchanges in body mass index , even in those not taking vitamin E (n = 17 ,18.8 ± 6.9 to 16.7 ± 7.3 , p = 0.0012). Vitamin B6 administration significantlyameliorated hepatic fat accumulation. As an inexpensive agent with few sideeffects , vitamin B6 could be a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment ofnonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

TI  - Enhanced water solubility , antioxidant activity , and oral absorption ofhesperetin by D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate andphosphatidylcholine.
PG  - 273-281

AB  - Hesperetin , an abundant bioactive component of citrus fruits , is poorlywater-soluble , resulting in low oral bioavailability. We developed newformulations to improve the water solubility , antioxidant activity , and oralabsorption of hesperetin. Two nano-based formulations were developed , namelyhesperetin-TPGS (D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) micelles andhesperetin-phosphatidylcholine (PC) complexes. These two formulations wereprepared by a simple technique called solvent dispersion , using US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved excipients for drugs. Differential scanningcalorimetry (DSC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to characterizethe formulations' physical properties. Cytotoxicity analysis , cellularantioxidant activity assay , and a pharmacokinetic study were performed toevaluate the biological properties of these two formulations. The final weightratios of both hesperetin to TPGS and hesperetin to PC were 1:12 based on theirwater solubility , which increased to 21.5- and 20.7-fold , respectively. Thehesperetin-TPGS micelles had a small particle size of 26.19 nm , whereas thehesperetin-PC complexes exhibited a larger particle size of 219.15 nm. Inaddition , the cellular antioxidant activity assay indicated that bothhesperetin-TPGS micelles and hesperetin-PC complexes increased the antioxidantactivity of hesperetin to 4.2- and 3.9-fold , respectively. Importantly , the invivo oral absorption study on rats indicated that the micelles and complexessignificantly increased the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) from 2.64 μg/mL to20.67 and 33.09 μg/mL and also increased the area under the concentration-timecurve of hesperetin after oral administration to 16.2- and 18.0-fold ,respectively. The micelles and complexes increased the solubility and remarkablyimproved the in vitro antioxidant activity and in vivo oral absorption ofhesperetin , indicating these formulations' potential applications in drugs andhealthcare products.

TI  - Lysosome restoration to activate podocyte autophagy: a new therapeutic strategyfor diabetic kidney disease.
PG  - 806
LID - 10.1038/s41419-019-2002-6 [doi]
LID - 806
AB  - Autophagy , the intracellular lysosomal degradation process plays a pivotal rolein podocyte homeostasis in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Lysosomal function ,autophagic activity , and their actions were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Wefound that LC3-II- and p62-positive vacuoles accumulated in podocytes of patientswith DKD. Moreover , we found that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) couldincrease the protein expression of LC3-II and p62 in a dose- and time-dependentmanner in cultured podocytes. However , the mRNA expression of LC3B , Beclin-1 orATG7 , as well as the protein level of Beclin-1 or ATG7 did not changesignificantly in the AGE-treated cells compared with that in control groups ,suggesting that AGEs did not induce autophagy. In addition , AGEs led to anincrease in the number of autophagosomes but not autolysosomes , accompanied witha failure in lysosomal turnover of LC3-II or p62 , indicating that the degradationof autophagic vacuoles was blocked. Furthermore , we observed a dramatic decreasein the enzymatic activities , and the degradation of DQ-ovalbumin wassignificantly suppressed after podocytes were treated with AGEs. Plasma-irregularlysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 granules accompanied with the diffusionof cathepsin D expression and acridine orange redistribution were observed inAGE-treated podocytes , indicating that the lysosomal membrane permeability wastriggered. Interestingly , we also found that AGEs-induced autophagic inhibitionand podocyte injury were mimicked by the specific lysosomotropic agent ,L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester. The exacerbated apoptosis and Rac-1-dependentactin-cytoskeletal disorganization were alleviated by an improvement in thelysosomal-dependent autophagic pathway by resveratrol plus vitamin E treatment inAGE-treated podocytes. However , the rescued effects were reversed by the additionof leupeptin , a lysosomal inhibitor. It suggests that restoring lysosomalfunction to activate autophagy may contribute to the development of newtherapeutic strategies for DKD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine antioxidant potentials of Allium sativum and Perseaamericana seeds extracts and three formulation-based extracts in vitro , and toevaluate the effects of the best formulation on oxidative stress and dyslipidemiaon rats fed with high fat and high sucrose diet (HFHSD). METHODS: Aqueousextracts of Allium sativum , Persia. americana and three formulations were mixedat various portions (A. s/P. a; w/w): F (1:1) , F (3: 1) , and F(1:3). They werethen tested for their antioxidant potentials in vitro using FRAP , DPPH and NOradicals to identify the best formulation. Four hundred (400) mg/kg b.w. offormulation F(1:1) were administered once daily for 21 days to rats previouslyfed with HFHSD for 8 weeks. Standard diet , vitamin E , and Atorvastatin were usedas controls. After 21 days , body weight , blood glucose , lipid markers , activitiesof transaminases and markers of the antioxidant systems were assessed. RESULTS:The Formulation F(1:1) showed the best in vitro activity with IC(50) values of6.5 and 2.23 mg/mL respectively for FRAP and DPPH- radical scavenging capacity.HFHSD caused a depletion of antioxidants associated with an increase ofpro-oxidants and all the lipid markers except HDL-c Treatment with F(1:1)significantly increased TAC , SOD , and catalase activities , while MDA , proteincarbonyls , and NO levels decreased (p < 0.05). Formulation F(1:1) decreasedtriglycerides (119.88 ± 4.25 mg/dL) and LDL-c (3.78 ± 0.66 mg/dL) levels andsignificantly increased the HDL-c level: (108.07 ± 6.29 mg/mL). Furthermore ,Formulation F(1:1) significantly caused weight loss (2.31%) , reduced bloodglucose levels (27.38%) and ALT activity. CONCLUSION: The formulation F(1:1)could be a good candidate for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress ,dyslipidemia and features of metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Vitamin E (VE) is a potent nutritional antioxidant that is critical inalleviating poultry oxidative stress. However , the hydrophobic nature and limitedstability of VE restrict its effective utilization. Nanotechnology offers apromising approach to enhance the bioavailability of lipophilic vitamins. Theobjective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of different sourcesand addition levels of VE on the growth performance , antioxidant capacity , VEabsorption site , and pharmacokinetics of Arbor Acres (AA) broilers. Three hundredand eighty-four 1-d-old AA chicks were randomly allocated into four groupssupplemented with 30 and 75 IU/kg VE as regular or nano. The results showed thatdietary VE sources had no significant impact on broiler growth performance.However , chickens fed 30 IU/kg VE had a higher average daily gain at 22 to 42 dand 1 to 42 d , and lower feed conversion ratio at 22 to 42 d than 75 IU/kg VE(P < 0.05). Under normal feeding conditions , broilers fed nano VE (NVE) displayedsignificantly higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathioneperoxidase (GSH-Px) enzyme activities and lower malonic dialdehyde (MDA)concentration (P < 0.05). Similarly , NVE had a higher antioxidant effect in thedexamethasone-constructed oxidative stress model. It was found that nanosizingtechnology had no significant effect on the absorption of VE in the intestinaltract by examining the concentration of VE in the intestinal tract (P > 0.05).However , compared to broilers perfused with regular VE (RVE) , the NVE groupdisplayed notably higher absorption rates at 11.5 and 14.5 h (P < 0.05).Additionally , broilers perfused with NVE showed a significant increase in thearea under the concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) ,mean residence time (MRT0-∞) , elimination half-life (t1/2z) , and peakconcentration (Cmax) of VE in plasma (P < 0.05). In summary , nanotechnologyprovides more effective absorption and persistence of VE in the blood circulationfor broilers , which is conducive to the function of VE and further improves theantioxidant performance of broilers.

OAB - With the rapid development of intensive farming , factors such as hightemperature , harmful gases , high-fat and high-protein diets , and changes infeeding methods have become causes of oxidative stress in animals. Studies haveshown that oxidative stress decreases livestock feed intake and slows growth inanimals , thereby affecting the quality of livestock products. Antioxidants andmicronutrients are commonly added to animal feed to reduce the effects ofoxidative stress. Since the progress in nanotechnology , nanovitamins have gainedextensive recognition due to their novel qualities , including a high level ofadsorption capacity and low toxicity. Therefore , the present study compared theeffects of dietary supplementation with different sources of vitamin E (regular ,RVE vs. nano , NVE) and varying inclusion levels on the growth performance ,antioxidant capacity , VE absorption sites , and pharmacokinetics in AA broilers.The results indicated that supplementing broiler diets with NVE provides superiorantioxidant benefits compared to RVE. This improvement is attributed to theenhanced absorption efficiency and extended half-life of NVE , both contributingto increased antioxidant performance of broilers.

AB  - Ambient particulate matter (APM) is extremely harmful to life's health. In thisstudy , we investigated cellular injury in cat (Felix catus) lung cells (FCA-L2)exposed to organic and water-soluble extracts from APM. As well , the protectiveeffect of vitamin E (VE) , lycopene and a mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (molar concentration ratio of 2:1) against thisdamage was evaluated. Organic and water-soluble extracts induced oxidative stressin FCA-L2 cells , as evidenced by excess reactive oxygen species production andmitochondrial damage , while treatment with VE , lycopene and EPA: DHA remarkablyalleviated these indices. It was further found that treatment with EPA: DHAdecreased lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde , as well as increasedactivities of superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Ourstudy confirmed that nutrients mediates APM-induced oxidative stress viaantioxidant proteins. Also , these findings could provide new insights intoreducing APM-induced cytotoxicity by nutritional supplementation based onantioxidant compounds for animals.

LID - 10.1017/S1751731118002409 [doi]
AB  - Data on production traits of the only Slovenian autochthonous pig breed , theKrškopolje pig , is very scarce. Krškopolje pigs are reared in conventional andorganic production systems , which were compared in the present study. Afterweaning , 24 barrows were assigned within litter to either conventional (CON) ororganic (ECO) rearing system. Group CON (n=12) was housed indoors in two pens(7.5 m2) with partly slatted floor. Group ECO (n=12) was held in a sty withsheltered area (concrete floor , bedded with straw , 16 m2) and outdoor paddockarea (100 m2). The trial started when pigs had 68±8 kg BW and 157±6 days of age.Two diets were formulated with equivalent ingredients and composition. For ECOdiet the ingredients used were ecological. Group ECO received a diet with 12.4 MJmetabolisable energy (ME) per kilogram and 12.9% CP and group CON a diet with12.7 MJ ME/kg and 13.6% CP. Feed distribution was limited to 3.5 kg per pigdaily. In line with the rules for organic production , ECO pigs were additionallygiven alfalfa hay ad libitum. After 73 days on trial , the pigs were slaughteredand carcass , meat and fat quality was evaluated. Meat quality traits (pH , colour ,water holding capacity) , fatty acid composition , lipid and protein oxidation ,collagen content and solubility were analysed in longissimus lumborum (LL)muscle. Fatty acid composition , lipid oxidation , and vitamins A and Econcentrations were determined in backfat. There were no significant differencesin growth rate and carcass traits between ECO and CON pigs , however , ECO pigstended (P&lt;0.10) to have higher daily gain and lower dressing percentage ,higher (P&lt;0.001) pH 45 min and lower (P&lt;0.01) pH 24 h postmortem , affecting(P&lt;0.10) also water holding capacity and objective colour parameters(P&lt;0.05) of LL muscle. There were no differences in intramuscular fat (IMF)content of LL muscle , however , IMF of ECO pigs had lower (P&lt;0.05) proportionof saturated and higher (P&lt;0.01) proportion of monounsaturated fatty acidsaccompanied by higher (P&lt;0.001) values of thiobarbituric reactive substances(TBARS). In backfat , ECO pigs showed lower (P&lt;0.05) vitamin E content , higher(P&lt;0.001) TBARS , higher (P&lt;0.01) degree of unsaturation (percentage ofpolyunsaturated fatty acids) , and also higher (P&lt;0.05) vitamin A concentrationthan CON pigs , which can be related to alfalfa hay supplementation of ECO pigs.In brief , organic rearing of Krškopolje pigs did not affect performances but hadan effect on meat and fat quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamins A and E play important roles in sustaining life activitiesand maintaining a good physical condition. However , most people , particularly theelderly , experience micronutrient deficiencies. This study aimed to establishreference intervals (RIs) for vitamins A and E in Chinese elderly people using aliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. METHODS: Atotal of 356 apparently healthy individuals aged ≥64 years who underwent healthcheckups were randomly selected for the study. Vitamin A and E levels weremeasured using LC-MS/MS. The effect of sex on vitamin A and E levels wasevaluated , and RIs were established using a parametric method. RESULTS: Femalesshowed significantly higher levels of vitamin E than males (p < 0.05). However ,no significant sex-specific difference was observed with vitamin A levels. The RIfor vitamin A in the elderly was 0.283-0.730 mg/L. For vitamin E , the RIs were4.39-15.63 , 4.51-16.14 , and 4.41-14.67 mg/L for the total , female , and maleparticipants , respectively. In multiple linear regression , alanineaminotransferase , glutamyl transpeptidase , urea , glucose , and uric acid levelsincreased with increasing vitamin A levels (p < 0.05) , and total cholesterol andlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased with increasing vitamin Elevels (p < 0.05). Direct bilirubin levels decreased with increasing vitamin Elevels (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study established RIs for vitamins A and Ein Chinese elderly individuals using an LC-MS/MS method. We also found thatfemales had significantly higher vitamin E levels than males. The findings couldprovide a scientific basis for interpreting vitamin status in the elderly.

PG  - 305-312
LID - 10.18388/abp.2020_6549 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the protective role of various lipids (oliveand soya oil) and vitamin (E and C) against the toxicity of thermally oxidizedghee in rabbits. Vanaspati ghee was thermally oxidized on a hot plate at 100°Cfor ten consecutive hours , and the oxidized ghee was stored in a refrigerator at-20°C until administration. Thirty male rabbits were purchased as experimentalanimals at a local market and were divided into ten corresponding groups of threebased on their body weight. The blood samples of 5 ml were collected on day 0 , 7 ,and 14 of the experiment for the analysis of hematological and biochemical serumparameters. We observed that oxidized ghee significantly elevated ALT level byaffecting liver hepatocytes. Furthermore , vitamin E rapidly decreased the ALTlevels compared to vitamin C and other oils. The oxidized ghee caused asignificant increase in cholesterol compared to the other groups. Vitamin E and Cshowed the best antioxidant activity and decreased cholesterol levels to normal.Histopathological examinations of the normal rabbits' liver sections revealed nosignificant histological abnormality. The liver of the rabbits fed with oxidizedghee had an intact lobular architecture but the portal tracts showed inflammationand mild fibrosis , the bile ducts showed proliferation , and the hepatocytesshowed feathery degeneration. In the liver sections from the groups fed withoxidized ghee and different doses of olive oil inflammation in portal tracts andlarge vacuoles in the hepatocytes were observed. The group fed with oxidized gheeand vitamin E had intact lobular architecture with no significant histologicalabnormality in portal tracts but fatty changes were present in the hepatocytes.These findings support the antioxidant activity of vitamins C and E as theyreduced liver infection caused by oxidized ghee. It was concluded that oxidizedghee was highly toxic and not safe for consumption. The present study indicatedthat soya bean oil and vitamin E were more effective in protecting against thetoxicity of thermally oxidized ghee than olive oil and vitamin C.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environmental pollutantscreated by incomplete combustion. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) , the prototypic PAH , isknown to exert toxicity through oxidative stress which is thought to occurthrough inhibition of antioxidant scavenging systems. The use of agents thatreduce oxidative stress may be a valuable route for ameliorating the adverseeffects of PAHs on neural development and behavior. This study was conducted todetermine if tocofersolan (a synthetic water-soluble analog of vitamin E)supplementation can prevent or reduce neurobehavioral deficits in zebrafishembryos exposed to BaP during early development. Newly hatched zebrafish wereassessed on locomotor activity and light responsivity. Zebrafish embryos wereexposed to vehicle (DMSO) , tocofersolan (0.3 μM-3 μM) , and/or BaP (5 μM) from5-120 hours post-fertilization. This concentration range was below the thresholdfor producing overt dysmorphogenesis or decreased survival. One day after the endof exposure the larval fish were tested for locomotor activity under alternatinglight and dark 10 min periods , BaP (5 μM) was found to cause locomotorhypoactivity in larval fish. Co-exposure of tocofersolan (1 μM) restoredcontrol-like locomotor function. Based on the findings of this study , this modelcan be expanded to assess the outcome of vitamin E supplementation on otherpotential environmental neurotoxicants , and lead to determination if this rescuepersists into adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute pancreatitis (AP) carries the risk of subsequentnutritional deficiencies. The prevalence of these deficiencies following a singleepisode of AP in children is unknown. We aimed to determine prevalence ofanthropometric and laboratory-based measures of nutritional status in childrenfollowing their first (index) admission for AP. METHODS: Prospectiveobservational cohort study of patients ≤21 years of age with first episode ofconfirmed AP. Anthropometric and laboratory values were obtained at time of APonset and at follow up time points of 3 and 12 months (m) post AP. AP attack wasclassified as either: mild , moderately severe or severe (which were combined inone group (SAP)). RESULTS: 181 patients met criteria and were followedprospectively with 52% male , a median age of 13.7 years (IQR 9.4-16.0) and medianBody Mass Index (BMI) Z-score of 0.6 (IQR -0.5 , 1.6). Most patients had mild AP(140 , 77%) , with 23% meeting criteria for moderate or severe (41/181). 6 (3%) haddiabetes mellitus (DM) predating AP and were excluded from further analysis. BMIZ-score remained stable during the follow up period. 13% of patients developedpre-DM or DM at 3m or 12m. Nearly one third of patients had low ferritin at 3m(29%) or 12m (29%). At 12m , 8% of patients had Vitamin A deficiency. 6% ofpatients had low Vitamin E levels at 3m and 5% at 12m. Over half of patients atboth 3m and 12m had 25 OH Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (56% and 56%).Prolonged International Normalized Ratio (INR) (>1.3) was seen in 9% of patientsat 12m. Very low albumin (<3.5 g/dL) was found in 24% of patients at 3m and 18%at 12m (Table 1). Patients with very low albumin at 3m were younger (median 10.7vs. 14.2 years , p = 0.04) , however sex , BMI Z-score and AP severity were notassociated with albumin level. Although BMI Z-score did not differ between thegroups , those with SAP had a significant decrease in BMI Z-score from firstattack compared to mild AP at 3m (-0.4 vs. 0.0 , p = 0.0002 , Figure 2). At 3m ,Vitamin E deficiency in SAP versus mild AP was found in 20% vs 2% (p = 0.04) andSAP had a lower median hematocrit (35.8 vs. 37.6 , p = 0.046). There were no otherlaboratory significant differences at 3m in mild versus SAP groups. At 12m , thosewith SAP were more likely to have pre-DM or DM compared to mild AP (31% vs. 7% ,p = 0.002). No other significant laboratory differences occurred at 12m.CONCLUSIONS: After the first AP attack patients experience nutritionaldeficiencies , including ferritin , all fat-soluble vitamins , and low albumin. SAPis associated with a decrease in BMI Z-score , increased prevalence of vitamin Edeficiency at 3m , and an increase in pre-diabetes and diabetes at 12m. Serialmonitoring of vitamin and mineral values post AP is warranted and furtherprospective studies are needed.

AB  - Fat-soluble vitamins are important efficacy indicators in health foods becausethey are essential for human physiological functions. The existing method for thesimultaneous determination of fat-soluble vitamins has various problems , such aslimited determination components , complex sample , pretreatment process , and highrequirements for personnel operating ability. Therefore , establishing a fast ,simple , and accurate method that can detect various common fat-soluble vitaminsat the same time is necessary. In this study , a method for the simultaneousdetermination of 10 commonly used fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A acetate(VA acetate) , vitamin A palmitate (VA palmitate) , vitamin E acetate (VE acetate) ,vitamin K(1) (VK(1)) , α-tocopherol , β-tocopherol , γ-tocopherol , δ-tocopherol ,vitamin D(2)(VD(2)) and vitamin D(3) (VD(3)) in health foods was established byultra performance convergence chromatography (UPC(2)). First , the contents ofabout 1.0 g of capsule samples were accurately weighed. A grinder was used togrind tablet samples into powder. The powder mixture was then precisely weighedat 2.0 g. Both substances were placed in 50 mL brown stopper tubes. The test tubewas then filled with 20 mL 75% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) aqueous solution fordemulsification. The tubes were then sonicated before being extracted withn-hexane. The centrifuged supernatant was added to vials for detection. ViridisHSS C18 SB column (100 mm×3.0 mm , 1.8 μm) was applied and CO(2) was used as themobile phase A. After comparing the influence of acetonitrile , methanol , andtheir mixture on chromatographic peak separation , acetonitrile-methanol (85∶15 ,v/v) was used as the mobile phase B. The injection volume was 1 μL. Usingsimulator software , the optimal chromatographic conditions were obtained after aset of three-factor orthogonal experiments of flow rate , gradient slope , andcolumn temperature. The flow rate and column temperature were both set at 1.9mL/min and 30 ℃. Furthermore , the maximum absorption wavelength of these 10fat-soluble vitamins was selected for detection. Ten vitamins were baselineseparated after 7 min of gradient elution. The limits of detection (LODs) andquantification (LOQs) of capsule samples were 0.4-60 μg/g and 2-150 μg/g ,respectively , whereas the results for tablet samples were 0.2-30 μg/g and 0.8-75μg/g. The linear ranges of the 10 fat-soluble vitamins were 0.1-100 μg/mL. Therecoveries of spiked samples ranged from 96.5% to 113.9% , with RSD values lessthan 4%. Precision , stability , and repeatability RSD values were all less than2%. By comparison , the determination results of this method were basicallyconsistent with the existing national food safety standards. This method issimple , rapid , sensitive , and accurate , and it can meet the detectionrequirements of the 10 fat-soluble vitamins in health foods. Simultaneously , thismethod lays the foundation for the rapid and simultaneous detection offat-soluble vitamins in existing health foods.

AB  - Dietary habits of middle-aged and elderly individuals affected by periodontaldisease (PD) differ from those who are unaffected by it , according to previousreports. However , in young adults , there are only a few reports that show acorrelation between nutrient/food intake and PD. Moreover , no report till datehas assessed the correlation between dietary habits and PD using aself-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ). Therefore , we assessed thiscorrelation using a DHQ in young adult women who are likely to develop PD. Theparticipants were enrolled from 2 universities and included 120 female collegestudents a mean age of 20.4 y. The participants were assessed for the presence ofPD according to the community periodontal index and were divided into two groups ,the PD group and the non-PD group. Their dietary habits were investigated using aDHQ and the level of difficulty in chewing food was assessed. The PD group had asignificantly lower nutrient intake of minerals , fat-soluble vitamins ,water-soluble vitamins , and dietary fiber than the non-PD group. In terms of foodgroups , the PD group consumed significantly lesser amounts of green and yellowvegetables (GYV) than the non-PD group. Multivariate analysis revealed that thePD group had significantly lower intakes of vitamin E and GYV than the non-PDgroup. The PD group consumed significantly lesser amounts of hard foods than thenon-PD group. In conclusion , young adult women who were evaluated for PD by ascreening test had a significantly lower nutrient/food intake than those withouta PD.

AB  - This present study aimed to determine the efficacy of supplementing layer dietswith vitamin A (0 , 8,000 and 16,000 IU/kg diet) and vitamin E (0 , 250 and 500mg/kg diet) either individually or in combination on egg production and quality ,and blood hematology and chemistry of birds reared under summer conditions. Atotal of 135 Bovans Brown laying hens were distributed to 9 treatment groups with5 replicates of 3 hens/pen in a 3 × 3 factorial design. A significant improvementin feed conversion ratio (FCR) was observed as supplementary vitamin A or Eincreased (P ≤ 0.01). Hens fed diets supplemented with 16,000 IU vitamin A plus500 mg vitamin E/kg diet had the best FCR among all groups. Egg quality traitswere not significantly affected by the interaction of vitamin A and vitamin Elevels. There was a significant increase in monocytes (P ≤ 0.01) and a decreasein basophils counts (P ≤ 0.05) in response to vitamin E. Significant decreaseswere observed in packed cell volume (PCV) , thyroxine (T(4)) , alanine transferase(ALT) , albumin , total cholesterol and total lipids ( (P ≤ 0.05 or P ≤ 0.01) P ≤0.01)  , and increases were observed in serum concentrations of globulin (P ≤0.05) and calcium (P ≤ 0.01) due to vitamin A. The combination of 0 IU vitamin Aand 500 mg vitamin E/kg diet had the highest values of PCV (40.09%) andhemoglobin (Hb) (10.33 mg/100 mL) among all groups. Vitamin E raised serum valuesof total protein , total cholesterol and total lipids (P ≤ 0.05 or P ≤ 0.01). Feedintake , FCR , PCV , Hb , lymphocytes , monocytes , eosinophils , T(4) , ALT and totalprotein were significantly affected by the interaction of vitamins A and E (P ≤0.05 or P ≤ 0.01). The interaction of vitamins A and E was only significant withrespect to serum total protein (P ≤ 0.05). It can be concluded that layer dietssupplemented with vitamins A and E had good results in alleviating the harmfulimpacts of high ambient temperature. The combination of 16,000 IU vitamin A and500 mg vitamin E per kilogram diet is preferable for obtaining better productionof laying hens reared under hot summer conditions.

TI  - Optimized vinpocetine-loaded vitamin E D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000succinate-alpha lipoic acid micelles as a potential transdermal drug deliverysystem: in vitro and ex vivo studies.
PG  - 33-43
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S187470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vinpocetine (VNP) , a semisynthetic natural product , is used as avasodilator for cerebrovascular and age-related memory disorders. VNP suffersfrom low oral bioavailability owing to its low water solubility and extensivefirst-pass metabolism. This work aimed at utilizing D-α-tocopherol polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and alpha lipoic acid (ALA) to develop efficientmicellar system for transdermal delivery of VNP. MATERIALS AND METHODS:VNP-TPGS-ALA micelles were prepared , characterized for particle size usingparticle size analyzer , and investigated for structure using transmissionelectron microscope. Optimization of VNP-TPGS-ALA micelles-loaded transdermalfilms was performed using Box-Behnken experimental design. The investigatedfactors were percentage of ALA in TPGS (X(1)) , citral concentration (X(2)) , andpropylene glycol concentration (X(3)). Elongation percent (Y(1)) , initialpermeation after 2 hours (Y(2)) , and cumulative permeation after 24 hours (Y(3))were studied as responses. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed optimum levelsof 16.62% , 3% , and 2.18% for X(1) , X(2) , and X(3) , respectively. Fluorescentlaser microscopic visualization of skin penetration of the optimized transdermalfilm revealed marked widespread fluorescence intensity in skin tissue after 0.5 ,2 , and 4 hours compared with raw VNP transdermal film formulation , whichindicated enhancement of VNP skin penetration. CONCLUSION: The obtained resultshighlighted the potentiality of VNP nanostructure-based films for controlling thetransdermal permeation of the drug and improving its effectiveness.

TI  - Development , Optimization , and Comparison of Different Sample Pre-Treatments forSimultaneous Determination of Vitamin E and Vitamin K in Vegetables.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25112509 [doi]
LID - 2509
AB  - The absence of vitamin E from the diet can lead to cardiovascular disease ,cancer , cataracts , and premature aging. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleedingdisorders. These fat-soluble vitamins are important nutritional factors that canbe determined in different methods in vegetables. In this work , the simultaneousdetermination of α-tocopherol , α-tocopheryl acetate , phylloquinone , andmenaquinone-4 by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been optimizedusing both direct injection and solid phase microextraction (SPME). Threedifferent sample pre-treatment approaches based on: (A)solid-liquid-liquid-liquid extraction (SLE-LLE) , (B) SLE , and (C) SPME were thenapplied to extract the target analytes from vegetables samples using menaquinoneas internal standard. All the procedures allowed the determination of the targetanalytes in onion , carrot , celery , and curly kale samples. Similar results wereobtained with the three different approaches , even if the one based on SPMEoffers the best performance , together with a reduced use of solvent , timeconsumption , and experimental complexity , which makes it the preferable optionfor industrial applications.

TI  - The Combination of Berberine , Tocotrienols and Coffee Extracts Improves MetabolicProfile and Liver Steatosis by the Modulation of Gut Microbiota and HepaticmiR-122 and miR-34a Expression in Mice.
LID - 10.3390/nu13041281 [doi]
LID - 1281
AB  - Non-alcoholic-fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is spreading worldwide. Specific drugsfor NAFLD are not yet available , even if some plant extracts show beneficialproperties. We evaluated the effects of a combination , composed by BerberisAristata , Elaeis Guineensis and Coffea Canephora , on the development of obesity ,hepatic steatosis , insulin-resistance and on the modulation of hepatic microRNAs(miRNA) levels and microbiota composition in a mouse model of liver damage.C57BL/6 mice were fed with standard diet (SD , n = 8) , high fat diet (HFD , n = 8)or HFD plus plant extracts (HFD+E , n = 8) for 24 weeks. Liver expression ofmiR-122 and miR-34a was evaluated by quantitativePCR. Microbiome analysis wasperformed on cecal content by 16S rRNA sequencing. HFD+E-mice showed lower bodyweight (p < 0.01) , amelioration of insulin-sensitivity (p = 0.021) , totalcholesterol (p = 0.014) , low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (p < 0.001) ,alanine-aminotransferase (p = 0.038) and hepatic steatosis compared to HFD-mice.While a decrease of hepatic miR-122 and increase of miR-34a were observed inHFD-mice compared to SD-mice , both these miRNAs had similar levels to SD-mice inHFD+E-mice. Moreover , a different microbial composition was found between SD- andHFD-mice , with a partial rescue of dysbiosis in HFD+E-mice. This combination ofplant extracts had a beneficial effect on HFD-induced NAFLD by the modulation ofmiR-122 , miR-34a and gut microbiome.

AB  - Ascorbic acid , widely known as vtamin C , is an essential nutrient for animalssuch as poultry. Ascorbic acid in poultry feed improves animal health and thusincreases the growth performance of birds. Ascorbic acid can be used in the formof synthetic products or can be naturally obtained from fruits and plants. It issoluble in water and can be easily administered in drinking water and the diet.Poultry can synthesize ascorbic acid in the body. However , the performance of theanimals can be improved by adding ascorbic acid to their diet. In addition ,ascorbic acid is called an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory. This increasestheir resistance to disease during the transition season. Ascorbic acidsupplementation positively affects the stress response , especially during the dryseason in tropical countries. Furthermore , supplementing ascorbic acid in thepoultry's diet improves resistance to diseases , regulates stress , and helps inthe body's oxidation process. Ultimately , this enhances the laying rate , egghatch performance , and higher poultry productivity. For layers at the end of thelaying period , it helps increase the quality of the eggshell and reduces theproportion of broken eggs. Ascorbic acid has a strong relationship with othervitamins such as vitamin E and other substances such as zinc , safflower oil ,folic acid , and a fibrous diet. This review aims to synthesize all theinformation of ascorbic acid in the poultry's diet , thereby providing the generalrole of ascorbic acid for the poultry industry.

AB  - This study aimed to present findings on a paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded polymericmicellar formulation based on polycaprolactone-vitamin E TPGS (PCL-TPGS) andevaluate its in vitro anticancer activity as well as its in vivo pharmacokineticprofile in healthy mice in comparison to a marketed formulation. Micelles wereprepared by a co-solvent evaporation method. The micelle's average diameter andpolydispersity were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique.Drug encapsulation efficiency was assessed using an HPLC assay. The in vitrocytotoxicity was performed on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231)using MTT assay. The in vivo pharmacokinetic profile was characterized followinga single intravenous dose of 4 mg/kg to healthy mice. The mean diameters of theprepared micelles were ≤ 100 nm. Moreover , these micelles increased the aqueoussolubility of PTX from ∼0.3 μg/mL to reach nearly 1 mg/mL. While the PTX-loadedmicelles showed an in vitro cytotoxicity comparable to the marketed formulation(Ebetaxel) , drug-free PCL-TPGS micelles did not show any cytotoxic effects onboth types of breast cancer cells (∼100% viability). Pharmacokinetics of PTX aspart of PCL-TPGS showed a significant increase in its volume of distributioncompared to PTX conventional formulation , Ebetaxel , which is in line with whatwas reported for clinical nano formulations of PTX , i.e. , Abraxane , Genexol-PM ,or Apealea. The findings of our studies indicate a significant potential forPCL-TPGS micelles to act as an effective system for solubilization and deliveryof PTX.

TI  - Using dried orange pulp in the diet of dairy goats: effects on milk yield andcomposition and blood parameters of dams and growth performance and carcassquality of kids.
PG  - 2212-2220
LID - 10.1017/S1751731120000932 [doi]
AB  - Although dried orange pulp (DOP) may conveniently replace cereals in ruminantdiets , few studies have considered similar diet substitution for goats. Wehypothesised that DOP could replace cereal-based concentrate in goat dietswithout detrimental effects on growth performance and carcass quality of sucklingkids and milk performance and blood biochemical parameters of dams in earlylactation. We also hypothesised that DOP substitution may increase the levels ofantioxidants , such as phenolic compounds and vitamin E , in milk and improve itstotal antioxidant capacity (TAC). Therefore , 44 primiparous Payoya dairy goatswere allocated to three experimental groups , each fed a different diet: control(CD , n = 14) based on a commercial concentrate with alfalfa hay as forage; andDOP40 (n = 16) in which 40% and DOP80 (n = 14) in which 80% of the cereal in theconcentrate were replaced by DOP. The experiment lasted from the final month ofpregnancy to 55 days postpartum. The DOP diets did not affect suckling kids'carcass quality , but at 28 days , led to improvement in live weight (LW) andaverage daily gain (ADG) from birth , although no differences were found betweenDOP40 and DOP80 (for CD , DOP40 and DOP80 , LW at 28 days was 8.00 , 8.58 and 8.34kg and ADG was 184 , 199 and 195 g/day , respectively). Diet had no significanteffect on milk yield (average daily milk yield and total yield at 55 days were1.66 l/day and 90.6 l , respectively) and commercial and fatty acid composition.Nevertheless , α-tocopherol , total phenolic compound (TPC) and TAC concentrationin milk increased with substitution of cereals by DOP (for CD , DOP40 and DOP80 ,concentration of α-tocopherol was 21.7 , 32.8 and 42.3 μg/100 g , TPCs was 63.5 ,84.1 and 102 mg gallic acid equivalents/l , and TAC was 6.63 , 11.1 and 12.8 μmolTrolox equivalents/ml , respectively). Every plasma biochemistry parameterconsidered was within reference values for healthy goats; therefore , nopathological effect was detected for these variables due to dietary treatment.However , DOP diets caused a reduction in plasmatic creatine kinase and aspartateaminotransferase , implying reduced oxidative damage to muscles. In conclusion ,DOP may be an interesting alternative to cereals in early lactation goat dietsfor increasing farmers' income and the healthy antioxidant capacity of milk.

AB  - Phytochemicals are essential raw materials for the production of formulationsthat can be helpful in crop protection. In particular , Hibiscus spp. , which areoften used in traditional medicine , are rich in potential bioactive molecules.This study presents an analysis of the thermal , vibrational , and phytochemicalcharacteristics of a light purple variety of Hibiscus syriacus , using thermalgravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry , Fourier-transform infraredspectroscopy , and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy techniques. Further , witha view to its valorization , the antimicrobial activity of its extracts has beeninvestigated in vitro against Erwinia amylovora (the phytopathogen responsiblefor fire blight in apples , pears , and some other members of the family Rosaceae) ,Erwinia vitivora (the causal agent of the "maladie d'Oléron" in grapevines) , andDiplodia seriata (responsible for "Bot canker"). Higher heating values andthermal features showed similarities with kenaf biomass. The main compoundsidentified in the hydro-methanolic extracts were: in flowers , 1-heptacosanol ,heptacosane , 1-tetracosanol , hexadecenoic acid , 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid ,and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid; and in leaves , the coumarin derivative4,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2-chromanone , vitamin E , phytol , and sitosterol. MIC valuesof 500 and 375 μg·mL(-1) were obtained against E. amylovora for flower and leafextracts , respectively , upon conjugation with chitosan oligomers (to improvesolubility and bioavailability). In the case of E. vitivora , MIC values of 250and 500 μg·mL(-1) , respectively , were registered. Regarding the antifungalactivity , EC(90) values of 975.8 and 603.5 μg·mL(-1) , respectively , were found.These findings suggest that H. syriacus (cv. 'Mathilde') may be a promisingsource of antimicrobials for agriculture.

TI  - Stabilization of PE with Pomegranate Extract: Contradictions and PossibleMechanisms.
LID - 10.3390/antiox11020418 [doi]
LID - 418
AB  - Dry pomegranate peel was extracted with acetone and the extract was added to aPhillips type polyethylene. The concentration of the extract was changed from 0to 1000 ppm in six steps and stabilization efficiency was checked by the multipleextrusion of the polymer followed by the characterization of chemical structure ,processing , and residual stability. The results confirmed the excellentprocessing stabilization efficiency of the extract , but also the poor long-termstability of PE containing it in accordance with previously published results.The extract is amorphous and its solubility is relatively large in the polymer;thus , these factors cannot be the reason for the poor stabilization efficiency inan oxygen-rich environment. Chemical factors like the self-interaction of thepolyphenol molecules , the stability of the radicals forming after hydrogenabstraction , and the lack of hydrogens with the necessary reactivity must beconsidered during the evaluation of the efficiency of the extract. These factorsas well as the insufficient number of active hydrogens hinder the reaction of theadditive molecules with oxygen-centered radicals , thus leading to inferiorlong-term stability. The extract can be used for the processing stabilization ofpolymers , but for applications requiring long-term stability , it must be combinedwith other natural antioxidants like flavonoids or Vitamin E.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tocochromanols are a group of lipid-soluble antioxidants produced byall plants and include the tocopherols , which are ubiquitous in the plantkingdom , and the biosynthetically-related compounds tocotrienols , which alongwith tocopherols commonly occur in seed of monocots. Most tocochromanols havesome level of vitamin E activity , with α-tocopherol being the highest , and assuch are essential nutrients in the human diet. Tocochromanols are particularlyabundant in seeds and are critical for maintaining seed longevity and propergermination and as seed oils are a major component of the human diet , they are animportant source of dietary vitamin E. In vegetative tissues , tocochromanols areimportant components in plant responses to stressful environments and canaccumulate to high levels in response to various stresses including high light ,heat , and dark. RESULTS: We report a robust , high throughput extraction and HPLCanalysis method to quantify the levels of tocopherols and tocotrienols in leavesand seeds of plants , using Arabidopsis and maize tissues as examples. CONCLUSION:The described method provides a rapid , high-throughput , cost-effective approachto quantifying the composition and content of tocopherols , and if neededsimultaneously tocotrienols , in vegetative tissues and seeds. Optimizedextraction methods are described for the two tissue types and have been used tostudy tocochromanol (vitamin E) natural variation in seed of large Arabidopsisand maize diversity panels , to assess gene function in T-DNA and Mu-taggedpopulations of Arabidopsis and maize , respectfully , and study the impact ofenvironmental stresses , including high light stress , heat stress , and dark ontocopherols content and composition of vegetative tissue.

AB  - Plastids are organelles responsible for essential aspects of plant development ,including carbon fixation and synthesis of several secondary metabolites.Chloroplast differentiation and activity are highly regulated by light , andseveral proteins involved in these processes have been characterised. Such is thecase of the GOLDEN 2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors , which induces theexpression of genes related to chloroplast differentiation and photosynthesis.The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome harbours two copies of this gene , SlGLK1and SlGLK2 , each with distinct expression patterns. While the former predominatesin leaves , the latter is mainly expressed in fruits , precisely at the pedicelregion. During tomato domestication , the selection of fruits with uniformripening fixed the mutation Slglk2 , nowadays present in most cultivatedvarieties , what penalised fruit metabolic composition. In this study , weinvestigated how SlGLK2 is regulated by light , auxin and cytokinin and determinedthe effect of SlGLK2 on tocopherol (vitamin E) and sugar metabolism , which arecomponents of the fruit nutritional and industrial quality. To achieve this ,transcriptional profiling and biochemical analysis were performed throughoutfruit development and ripening from SlGLK2 , Slglk2 , SlGLK2-overexpressinggenotypes , as well as from phytochrome and hormonal deficient mutants. Theresults revealed that SlGLK2 expression is regulated by phytochrome-mediatedlight perception , yet this gene can induce chloroplast differentiation even in aphytochrome-independent manner. Moreover , auxin was found to be a negativeregulator of SlGLK2 expression , while SlGLK2 enhances cytokinin responsiveness.Additionally , SlGLK2 enhanced chlorophyll content in immature green fruits ,leading to an increment in tocopherol level in ripe fruits. Finally , SlGLK2overexpression resulted in higher total soluble solid content , possibly by theregulation of sugar metabolism enzyme-encoding genes. The results obtained hereshed light on the regulatory network that interconnects SlGLK2 , phytohormones andlight signal , promoting the plastidial activity and consequently , influencing thequality of tomato fruit.

TI  - Aflatoxin compromises development of the preimplantation bovine embryo throughmechanisms independent of reactive oxygen production.

AB  - Aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen often found in animal feedstuffs. Although itreportedly impairs development of the preimplantation pig embryo , it is not knownwhether it adversely affects development of the preimplantation bovine embryo. Weconducted 3 experiments to investigate this possibility and determine whetherdeleterious effects of aflatoxin were caused by increased production of reactiveoxygen species (ROS). Experiments were conducted with embryos produced in vitroand cultured after fertilization with various concentrations of aflatoxin. Forexperiment 1 , embryos were treated with 0 (control) , 40 , 400 , or 4,000 µg/L ofaflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)). Treatment at all concentrations of AFB(1) tended toreduce cleavage rate , with the 2 highest concentrations having significanteffects. As compared with the control , 40 µg/L AFB(1) reduced the percentage ofoocytes becoming blastocysts and the percentage of cleaved embryos becomingblastocysts (19.7 vs. 8.1% and 30.3 vs. 14.3% , respectively). Complete inhibitionof blastocyst formation occurred at concentrations of 400 and 4,000 µg/L ofAFB(1). Experiments 2 and 3 involved a 2 × 2 factorial design with effects ofAFB(1) (0 and 40 µg/L) , the antioxidant Trolox(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid , a water-soluble analogof vitamin E; 0 and 5 µM) , and their interaction on production of ROS in putativezygotes (experiment 2) and development to the blastocyst stage (experiment 3).Production of ROS was increased by AFB(1) , and this effect was reversed byTrolox. However , Trolox did not prevent the reduction in development to theblastocyst stage caused by AFB(1). Thus , the anti-developmental effects of AFB(1)are not caused solely by increased ROS production. Rather , other underlyingmechanisms exist for the adverse effects of aflatoxin on embryonic development.Overall , results indicate the potential for feeding aflatoxin-contaminated feedto cause embryonic loss in cattle.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro effects of crocetin and its amide derivative onacrylamide-induced neurotoxicity.
PG  - 78-89
LID - 10.22038/AJP.2023.22316 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acrylamide (ACR) is a neurotoxic agent whose damage could beattenuated by antioxidants administration. Crocetin is a saffron-derivedantioxidant that has neuroprotective effects. This study evaluates the protectiveeffects of trans-sodium crocetinate (TSC) and its water-soluble derivative ,Bis-N-(N-methylpyprazinyl) crocetinate (BMPC) against ACR neurotoxicity.MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC12 cells were treated with TSC and BMPC (1.95 , 3.9 ,7.81 , 15.62 , 31.25 , 62.5 , 125 , 250 , 500 , and 1000 μM) for 24 hr. ACR was thenadded at a concentration of 6.5 mM (IC(50)) , and cell viability was assessed by3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. In the in vivostudy , male Wistar rats were treated with ACR (50 mg/kg , intraperitoneal (i.p.))for 11 days alone or in combination with TSC and BMPC (2.5 , 5 , and 10 mg/kg ,i.p.) or vitamin E (200 IU/kg , i.p.). Motor impairments were then evaluated. Thecerebral cortex of sacrificed rats was taken for the malondialdehyde (MDA) andglutathione (GSH) levels measurement. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that TSCat a concentration of 7.81 μM and BMPC at concentrations of 3.9 , 7.81 , and 15.62μM exhibited the lowest toxicity in acrylamide administration. In the in vivostudy , pretreatment with 2.5 , 5 , and 10 mg/kg of TSC ameliorated behavioralimpairments , but BMPC could not attenuate them. GSH and MDA were improved by 2.5 ,5 , and 10 mg/kg TSC and 2.5 mg/kg BMPC. CONCLUSION: TSC and BMPC administrationimproved behavioral index and oxidative stress injuries in Wistar rats exposed toACR through MDA reduction and GSH content enhancement in the cerebral cortex.

AB  - Background: Vinpocetine (VPN) is a synthetic derivative of the Vincaminor alkaloids. The drug is characterized by a short half-life , limited watersolubility and high hepatic first-pass effect. The objective was to developdifferent lipid-based nanocarriers (NCs) loaded into a thermosensitive in situgelling (ISG) system to improve VPN bioavailability and brain targeting viaintranasal (IN) delivery. Methods:  Different lipid-based NCs were developed andcharacterized for vesicle size , zeta potential , VPN entrapment efficiency (EE)and morphological characterization using transmission electron microscope (TEM).The prepared NCs were loaded into ISG formulations and characterized for theirmucoadhesive properties. Ex-vivo permeation and histological study of the nasalmucosa were conducted. Pharmacokinetic and brain tissue distribution wereinvestigated and compared to a marketed VPN product following administration of asingle dose to rats. Results: VPN-D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000succinate (TPGS) micelles nano-formulation showed the smallest particle size ,highest EE among the studied NCs. TEM images revealed an almost spherical shapefor all the prepared NCs. Among the NCs studied , VPN-loaded TPGS micellesdemonstrated the highest percent cumulative VPN ex vivo permeation. All theprepared ISG formulations revealed the presence of mucoadhesive properties andshowed no signs of inflammation or necrosis upon histological examination. Ratsadministered IN VPN-loaded TPGS-micelles ISG showed superior VPN concentration inthe brain tissue and significant high relative bioavailability when compared tothat received raw VPN-loaded ISG and marketed drug oraltablets. VPN-D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) micellesnano-formulation showed the smallest particle size , highest EE among the studiedNCs. TEM images revealed an almost spherical shape for all the prepared NCs.Among the NCs studied , VPN-loaded TPGS micelles demonstrated the highest percentcumulative VPN ex vivo permeation. All the prepared ISG formulations revealed thepresence of mucoadhesive properties and showed no signs of inflammation ornecrosis upon histological examination. Rats administered IN VPN-loadedTPGS-micelles ISG showed superior VPN concentration in the brain tissue andsignificant high relative bioavailability when compared to that received rawVPN-loaded ISG and marketed drug oral tablets. Conclusion: VPN-loadedTPGS-micelles ISG formulation is a successful brain drug delivery system withenhanced bioavailability for drugs with poor bioavailability and those that arefrequently administered.

TI  - The Bisphenol A Induced Oxidative Stress in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver DiseaseMale Patients: A Clinical Strategy to Antagonize the Progression of the Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17103369 [doi]
LID - 3369
AB  - :Introduction: Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been correlated to non-alcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD) development and progression. We investigated , in aclinical model , the effects of the administration of 303 mg of silybinphospholipids complex , 10 g of vitamin D , and 15 mg of vitamin E (RealSIL , 100D ,IBI-Lorenzini , Aprilia , Italy) in male NAFLD patients exposed to BPA onmetabolic , hormonal , and oxidative stress-related parameters. METHODS: Weenrolled 32 male patients with histologic diagnosis of NAFLD and treated themwith Realsil 100D twice a day for six months. We performed at baseline clinical ,biochemical , and food consumption assessments as well as the evaluation ofphysical exercise , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) , plasmatic andurinary BPA and estrogen levels. The results obtained were compared with those ofhealthy control subjects and , in the NAFLD group , between baseline and the end oftreatment. RESULTS: A direct proportionality between TBARS levels and BPAexposure was shown (p < 0.0001). The therapy determined a reduction of TBARSlevels (p = 0.011) , an improvement of alanine aminotransferase , aspartateaminotransferase , insulinemia , homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance , Creactive protein , tumor necrosis factor alpha (p < 0.05) , an increase ofconjugated BPA urine amount , and a reduction of its free form (p < 0.0001; p =0.0002). Moreover , the therapy caused an increase of plasmatic levels of thenative form of estrogens (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted the potentialrole of BPA in estrogen oxidation and oxidative stress in NAFLD patients. The useof Realsil 100D could contribute to fast BPA detoxification and to improvecellular antioxidant power , defending the integrity of biologicalestrogen-dependent pathways.

TI  - Impact of Production Systems on the Levels of Vitamin E , β-Carotene , andCholesterol in the Liver of Cattle Raised in the Eastern Amazon.
LID - 10.3390/foods13111595 [doi]
LID - 1595
AB  - The nutritional composition of bovine liver , particularly in terms of vitamins E ,β-carotene , and cholesterol concentration , is significantly influenced by thecattle-rearing system and diet. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of fourpredominant cattle-rearing systems in the Eastern Amazon region on the vitamin E ,β-carotene content , and cholesterol levels in bovine liver during the rainyseason. Liver-tissue samples were collected from 48 cattle , with twelve specimensrepresenting each rearing system. The systems encompassed two native pastureslocated in flood-prone areas , cultivated pastures on upland terrain and aconfinement-rearing system. Our findings indicate that , when considering allrearing systems collectively , there were no significant differences in the levelsof vitamins and cholesterol in the liver tissues (p > 0.05). However , a markeddisparity in cholesterol levels emerged when comparing intensive rearing systemsto extensive ones , with the former demonstrating notably higher concentrations (p= 0.01). Additionally , the intensive rearing system was associated with elevatedlevels of β-carotene (p < 0.01) , α-tocopherol (p = 0.01) , and β-tocopherol (p =0.01) relative to the extensive systems. No significant variations were observedamongst the different extensive systems (p > 0.05). These results suggest that ,while all rearing systems yielded liver tissues with typical concentrations ofvitamins and cholesterol , the intensive rearing system led to a higheraccumulation of certain vitamin compounds. This study highlights the substantialnutritional implications of different cattle-rearing systems in the EasternAmazon and provides valuable insights for developing dietary strategies tooptimize the nutritional quality of bovine liver. Therefore , the generatedresults are groundbreaking in the Eastern Amazon , Brazil , and inspire thedevelopment of new research projects to address other demands in this field andachieve additional outcomes.

TI  - Inhibition of Osteocyte Membrane Repair Activity via Dietary Vitamin EDeprivation Impairs Osteocyte Survival.
PG  - 224-234
LID - 10.1007/s00223-018-0487-0 [doi]
AB  - Osteocytes experience plasma membrane disruptions (PMD) that initiatemechanotransduction both in vitro and in vivo in response to mechanical loading ,suggesting that osteocytes use PMD to sense and adapt to mechanical stimuli. PMDrepair is crucial for cell survival; antioxidants (e.g. , alpha-tocopherol , alsoknown as Vitamin E) promote repair while reactive oxygen species (ROS) , which canaccumulate during exercise , inhibit repair. The goal of this study was todetermine whether depleting Vitamin E in the diet would impact osteocyte survivaland bone adaptation with loading. Male CD-1 mice (3 weeks old) were fed either aregular diet (RD) or Vitamin E-deficient diet (VEDD) for up to 11 weeks. Micefrom each dietary group either served as sedentary controls with normal cageactivity , or were subjected to treadmill exercise (one bout of exercise or dailyexercise for 5 weeks). VEDD-fed mice showed more PMD-affected osteocytes (+ 50%)after a single exercise bout suggesting impaired PMD repair following Vitamin Edeprivation. After 5 weeks of daily exercise , VEDD mice failed to show anexercise-induced increase in osteocyte PMD formation , and showed signs ofincreased osteocytic oxidative stress and impaired osteocyte survival.Surprisingly , exercise-induced increases in cortical bone formation rate wereonly significant for VEDD-fed mice. This result may be consistent with previousstudies in skeletal muscle , where myocyte PMD repair failure (e.g. , with musculardystrophy) initially triggers hypertrophy but later leads to widespreaddegeneration. In vitro , mechanically wounded MLO-Y4 cells displayed increasedpost-wounding necrosis (+ 40-fold) in the presence of H(2)O(2) , which could beprevented by Vitamin E pre-treatment. Taken together , our data support the ideathat antioxidant-influenced osteocyte membrane repair is a vital aspect of bonemechanosensation in the osteocytic control of PMD-driven bone adaptation.

TI  - Development of a Novel Nano-emulsion Formulation to Improve Intestinal Absorptionof Cannabidiol.
PG  - 35-42
LID - 10.1159/000497361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) is highly lipophilic , and its oral bioavailabilityis known to be very low in humans. In this study , we developed a novelnanoemulsion preparation of CBD (CBD-NE) to improve the poor solubility andabsorption of CBD. The pharmacokinetic profiles of CBD in rats were evaluatedafter oral administrations of CBD oil and CBD-NE , and the effect of bilesecretion on CBD absorption was also evaluated. METHODS: The CBD-NE formulationdeveloped in this study consisted of vitamin E acetate , ethanol , Tween-20 , anddistilled water (1.7/3.8/70/24.5 , w/w%). A CBD oil formulation (CBD oil , control)100 mg/kg or CBD-NE 50 mg/kg was orally administered to rats , and the bloodsamples were collected over time. Moreover , the CBD oil or CBD-NE was orallyadministered to bile-fistulated rats , and the pharmacokinetic profiles of CBDwere also evaluated. CBD concentrations in plasma were measured using LC-MS/MS.RESULTS: The particle size of CBD-NE was 35.3 ± 11.8 nm. Mean T(max) of CBD-NEwas shortened significantly by the factor of 3 (from 8.00 to 2.40 h , p < 0.001)and AUC(0-)(∞)/dose increased by 65% (from 0.272 ± 0.045 to 0.448 ± 0.087 h L/kg)compared with CBD oil. AUC(0-)(∞)/dose and C(max)/dose after oral administrationof CBD oil were significantly reduced by the factor of 27 and 23 (p < 0.05 and p< 0.01) , respectively , in bile-fistulated rats compared with the untreated rats.In contrast , all pharmacokinetic parameters after oral administration of CBD-NEwere not significantly different between the untreated and bile-fistulated rats.Therefore , these results demonstrated that conventional CBD oil formulation butnot CBD-NE requires bile-mediated micelle formation. CONCLUSIONS: The novel NEformulation developed in this study successfully improved the absorption of CBDregardless of bile secretion. The newly developed oral CBD-NE preparation couldbe useful to achieve a more stable and quicker onset of action by CBD.

AB  - This study examined if regulating the keap-1? Nrf2 antioxidant pathway mediatedgold nanoparticles (AuNPs) induced liver damage , and examined the protectiveeffect of co-supplement of α-lipoic acid (α-LA). Rats were separated into 4groups (n = 8/each) as control , α-LA (200 mg/kg) , AuNPs (5 µg/2.85 × 10(11)) , andAuNPs (5 µg/2.85 × 10(11)) + α-LA (200 mg/kg). After 7 days , AuNPs induced severedegeneration in the livers of rats with the appearance of some fatty changes. Inaddition , it increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) andgamma-glutamyl transferase (ɣ-GTT) , and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) , as wellas liver levels of malondialdehyde (MDA). Concomitantly , AuNPs significantlydepleted hepatic levels of total glutathione (GSH) , superoxide dismutase (SOD) ,and catalase (CAT) but increased hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). It also reduced mRNA levels of B-cell lymphoma2 (Bcl2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) but significantly increased those of Bax andcleaved caspase-3 , as well as the ratio of Bax/Bcl2. In addition , AuNPs enhancedthe total and nuclear levels of NF-κB p65 but reduced the mRNA and total andnuclear protein levels of Nrf2. Of note , AuNPs did not affect the mRNA levels ofkeap-1. All these events were reversed by α-LA in the AuNPs-treated rats. Inconclusion , α-LA attenuated AuNPs-mediated liver damage in rats by suppressingoxidative stress and inflammation , effects that are associated withupregulation/activation of Nrf2.

TI  - Genome-wide association analysis of natural variation in seed tocochromanols ofbarley.
PG  - e20039
LID - 10.1002/tpg2.20039 [doi]
AB  - Tocochromanols (tocols for short) , commonly called Vitamin E , are lipid-solubleplant antioxidants vital for regulating lipid peroxidation in chloroplasts andseeds. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seeds contain all eight different isoforms oftocols; however , the extent of natural variation in their composition and theirunderlying genetic basis is not known. Tocol levels in barley seeds werequantified in diverse H. vulgare panels comprising 297 wild lines from adiversity panel and 160 cultivated spring-type accessions from the mini-corepanel representing the genetic diversity of the USDA barley germplasm collection.Significant differences were observed in the concentration of tocols between thetwo panels. To identify the genes associated with tocols , genome-wide associationanalysis was conducted with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from Illuminaarrays for the mini-core panel and genotyping-by-sequencing for the wild barleypanel. Forty unique SNPs in the wild barley and 27 SNPs in the mini-core panelwere significantly associated with various tocols. Marker-trait associations(MTAs) were identified on chromosomes 1 , 6 , and 7 for key genes in the tocolbiosynthesis pathway , which have also been reported in other studies. Severalnovel MTAs were identified on chromosomes 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 and were found to be inproximity to genes involved in the generation of precursor metabolites requiredfor tocol biosynthesis. This study provides a valuable resource for barleybreeding programs targeting specific isoforms of seed tocols and forinvestigating the physiological roles of these metabolites in seed longevity ,dormancy , and germination.

AB  - Today , skin care products and cosmetic preparations containing naturalingredients are widely preferred by consumers. Therefore , many cosmetic brandsare encouraged to offer more natural products to the market , such as plantextracts that can be used for their antiaging , antiwrinkle , and depigmentationproperties and other cosmetic purposes. In the current study , the volatileconstituents of the hexane-soluble fraction of a Stenocarpus sinuatus (familyProteaceae) leaf methanol extract (SSHF) were analyzed using GC/MS analysis.Moreover , the antiaging activity of SSHF was evaluated through in vitro studiesof anti-collagenase , anti-elastase , anti-tyrosinase , and anti-hyaluronidaseactivities. In addition , an in silico docking study was carried out to identifythe interaction mechanisms of the major compounds in SSHF with the active sitesof the target enzymes. Furthermore , an in silico toxicity study of the identifiedcompounds in SSHF was performed. It was revealed that vitamin E (α-tocopherol)was the major constituent of SSHF , representing 52.59% of the extract , followedby γ-sitosterol (8.65%) , neophytadiene (8.19%) , β-tocopherol (6.07%) , and others.The in vitro studies showed a significant inhibition by SSHF of collagenase ,elastase , tyrosinase , and hyaluronidase , with IC(50) values of 60.03 , 177.5 ,67.5 , and 38.8 µg/mL , respectively , comparable to those of the positive controlsepigallocatechin gallate (ECGC , for collagenase , elastase , hyaluronidase) andkojic acid (for tyrosinase). Additionally , the molecular docking study revealedgood acceptable binding scores of the four major compounds , comparable to thoseof ECGC and kojic acid. Besides , the SSHF identified phytoconstituents showed nopredicted potential toxicity nor skin toxicity , as determined in silico. Inconclusion , the antiaging potential of SSHF may be attributed to its high contentof vitamin E in addition to the synergetic effect of other volatile constituents.Thus , SSHF could be incorporated in pharmaceutical skin care products andcosmetics after further studies.

AB  - One of the tomato's acutely devastating diseases is Alternaria leaf spot ,lowering worldwide tomato production. In this study , one fungal isolate wasisolated from tomatoes and was assigned to Alternaria alternata TAA-05 uponmorphological and molecular analysis of the ITS region and 18SrRNA , endoPG , Alta1 , and gapdh genes. Also , Urtica dioica and Dodonaea viscosa methanol leafextracts (MLEs) were utilized as antifungal agents in vitro and compared toRidomil , a reference chemical fungicide. The in vitro antifungal activity resultsrevealed that Ridomil (2000 µg/mL) showed the highest fungal growth inhibition(FGI) against A. alternata (96.29%). Moderate activity was found against A.alternata by D. viscosa and U. dioica MLEs (2000 µg/mL) , with an FGI value of56.67 and 54.81% , respectively. The abundance of flavonoid and phenoliccomponents were identified by HPLC analysis in the two plant extracts. Theflavonoid compounds , including hesperidin , quercetin , and rutin were identifiedusing HPLC in D. viscosa MLE with concentrations of 11.56 , 10.04 , and 5.14 µg/mLof extract and in U. dioica MLE with concentrations of 12.45 , 9.21 , and5.23 µg/mL , respectively. α-Tocopherol and syringic acid , were also identified inD. viscosa MLE with concentrations of 26.13 and 13.69 µg/mL , and in U. dioicaMLE , with values of 21.12 and 18.33 µg/mL , respectively. Finally , the bioactivityof plant extracts suggests that they play a crucial role as antifungal agentsagainst A. alternata. Some phenolic chemicals , including coumaric acid ,caffeic acid , ferulic acid , and α-tocopherol , have shown that they may beutilized as environmentally friendly fungicidal compounds.

TI  - Protective Effects of Several Common Amino Acids , Vitamins , Organic Acids ,Flavonoids and Phenolic Acids against Hepatocyte Damage Caused by Alcohol.
LID - 10.3390/foods11193014 [doi]
LID - 3014
AB  - With the increase in alcohol consumption , more and more people are suffering fromalcoholic liver disease (ALD). Therefore , it is necessary to elaborate thepathogenesis of ALD from the aspects of alcohol metabolism and harm. In thisstudy , we established an alcoholic liver injury model in vitro by inducing L02cells with different concentration of ethanol and acetaldehyde. Results showedthat the metabolism of ethanol can promote the content of ROS , MDA , TNF-α , IL-6 ,and caspase 3 , causing oxidative and inflammatory stress and membranepermeability changes. However , unmetabolized ethanol and acetaldehyde had littleeffect on cell membrane permeability and inflammation , indicating that ethanolmetabolites were the main reason for cell membrane damage. We also evaluated theeffects of amino acids (taurine and methionine) , vitamins (E and vitamin D) ,organic acids (malic acid and citric acid) , flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) , andphenolic acids (ferulic acid and chlorogenic acid) on alcohol-induced cellmembrane damage of L02 cells. Chlorogenic acid , taurine , vitamin E , and citricacid had remarkable effects on improving cell membrane damage. Malic acid , rutin ,quercetin , and ferulic acid had obvious therapeutic effects , while vitamin D andmethionine had poor therapeutic effects. The relationship between the structureand effect of active ingredients can be further studied to reveal the mechanismof action , and monomers can be combined to explore whether there is a synergisticeffect between functional components , in order to provide a certain theoreticalbasis for the actual study of liver protection.

TI  - Encapsulation of Vitamin E in Yogurt-Based Beverage Emulsions: Influence of BulkPasteurization and Chilled Storage on Physicochemical Stability and StarterCulture Viability.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26061504 [doi]
LID - 1504
AB  - Yogurt is a nutritious food that is regularly consumed in many countries aroundthe world and is widely appreciated for its organoleptic properties. Despite itscontribution to human dietary requirements , yogurt in its traditional recipe is apoor source of fat-soluble vitamins. To respond to consumer demands and furtherincrease the nutritional value of this product , this work aimed to fortify yogurtwith vitamin E by using emulsification as the method of encapsulation. Theeffects of thermal processing and chilled storage on the physicochemicalstability of the yogurt-based beverage was investigated. Vitamin E was onlyminorly affected by bulk pasteurization at 63 °C for 30 min and remained stableduring storage at 4 °C for 28 days. Fortified samples showed increased in vitroantioxidant activity compared with non-fortified samples. Lactic acid bacterialcounts were above the minimum recommended levels (>10(6) cfu/g) after processingand storage. In conclusion , this work has demonstrated that emulsification can bean effective strategy for developing yogurt-based products fortified with fatsoluble vitamins.

TI  - Combined administration of PTX and S-HM-3 in TPGS/Solutol micelle system foroncotarget therapy.
PG  - 1011-1026
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S189864 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: S-HM-3 is a tumor angiogenesis inhibitor with short half-life (25min). In this present , TPGS/Solutol polymeric micelles was prepared to loadtogether insoluble paclitaxel (PTX) and soluble S-HM-3 , expecting to togetherdeliver them to the tumor site with long-circulating , targeting function andcombating multi-drug resistance (MDR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: PTX and S-HM-3loaded TPGS/Solutol micelles (PHTSm) were prepared by the method of thin-filmevaporation , and characterized by dynamic light scattering , transmission electronmicroscope (TEM) , atomic force microscopy (AFM) and releasing properties. Theanticancer effect of the polymeric micelles system was evaluated and confirmed byexperiments of in vitro cell uptake study , in vivo pharmacokinetics , andpharmacodynamics studies. RESULTS: Micelles exhibited smooth spherical morphologywith 20~30 nm and low critical micelle concentration (CMC) value of 0.000124mg/mL. Only about 30% of PTX were slowly released from micelles at 48h , which canbeneficial to the long circulation in blood. The results of in vitro cell assayproved that S-HM-3 could be easier to get into MDA-MB-231 cell , and itsangiogenesis inhibition ability was also enhanced after integrating intomicelles. In particular , the results of in vivo studies showed that the half-lifeof S-HM-3 and PTX was significantly prolonged 25.27 and 5.54 folds , and theirAUC(0-∞) was enhanced 129.78 and 15.65 times , respectively. Meanwhile 83.05%tumor inhibition rate of PHTSm was achieved compared with 59.99% of PTX.CONCLUSIONS: TPGS and Solutol micelles hold promising potential to resolve theconundrum of combined therapy of cytotoxic drug and angiogenesis inhibitor withdifferent physicochemical property and anticancer mechanism in clinical use.

TI  - Cationic N,N-Dimethylglycine Ester Prodrug of 2R-α-Tocotrienol PromotesIntestinal Absorption via Efficient Self-Micellization with Intrinsic Bile AcidAnion.

AB  - The intestinal absorption of hydrophobic compounds is severely influenced bytheir transportation rate through the unstirred water layer in the intestinallumen. A member of the vitamin E family , α-Tocotrienol (α-T3) has remarkablepharmacological effects , but its intestinal absorption is hampered due to itshydrophobicity. Here , we prepared three ester derivatives of 2R-α-T3 , and weselected a suitable prodrug compound using rat plasma and liver microsomes. Themicellization profile of the selected compound in the presence of taurocholicacid (TCA) was evaluated. After gastrostomy administration of the prodrugcandidate or α-T3 solution containing TCA , AUC values were determined for α-T3 inplasma obtained from bile duct-ligated rats. Among the three types in theefficiency of the reconversion to the parent drug , α-T3 N,N-dimethylglycinate(α-T3DMG) was the best prodrug; α-T3DMG formed mixed micelles via ion pairs withanionic TCA. The solubility of α-T3DMG in n-octanol/water depended on its ratioto TCA. The AUC after α-T3DMG administration to ligated rats was 2-fold higherthan that after α-T3 administration , suggesting a smooth interaction withintrinsic bile acids. In conclusion , utilization of the prodrug synthesized usingN,N-dimethylglycine ester may be a beneficial approach to promote intestinalabsorption of α-T3 via self-micellization with intrinsic bile acid.

TI  - Gamma-Tocotrienol Protects the Intestine from Radiation Potentially byAccelerating Mesenchymal Immune Cell Recovery.
LID - 10.3390/antiox8030057 [doi]
LID - 57
AB  - Natural antioxidant gamma-tocotrienol (GT3) , a vitamin E family member , providesintestinal radiation protection. We seek to understand whether this protection ismediated via mucosal epithelial stem cells or sub-mucosal mesenchymal immunecells. Vehicle- or GT3-treated male CD2F1 mice were exposed to total bodyirradiation (TBI). Cell death was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Villus height and crypt depthwere measured with computer-assisted software in tissue sections. Functionalactivity was determined with an intestinal permeability assay. Immune cellrecovery was measured with immunohistochemistry and Western blot , and theregeneration of intestinal crypts was assessed with ex vivo organoid culture. Asingle dose of GT3 (200 mg/kg body weight (bwt)) administered 24 h before TBIsuppressed cell death , prevented a decrease in villus height , increased cryptdepth , attenuated intestinal permeability , and upregulated occludin level in theintestine compared to the vehicle treated group. GT3 accelerated mesenchymalimmune cell recovery after irradiation , but it did not promote ex vivo organoidformation and failed to enhance the expression of stem cell markers. Finally , GT3significantly upregulated protein kinase B or AKT phosphorylation after TBI.Pretreatment with GT3 attenuates TBI-induced structural and functional damage tothe intestine , potentially by facilitating intestinal immune cell recovery. Thus ,GT3 could be used as an intestinal radioprotector.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the more severe , inflammatorytype of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH , a leading indication forliver transplantation , is growing in prevalence. The extent of liver fibrosis ,ranging from fibrosis stage (FS) of none (F0) to cirrhosis (F4) , is a strongpredictor of health outcomes. There is little information on patient demographicsand clinical characteristics by fibrosis stage and NASH treatment outside ofacademic medical centers. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observationalstudy using Ipsos' syndicated NASH Therapy Monitor database , consisting ofmedical chart audits provided by sampled NASH-treating physicians in the UnitedStates in 2016 (n = 174) and 2017 (n = 164). Data was collected online. RESULTS:Of 2,366 patients reported on by participating physicians and included in theanalysis , 68% had FS F0-F2 , 21% had bridging fibrosis (F3) , and 9% had cirrhosis(F4). Common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes (56%) , hyperlipidemia (44%) ,hypertension (46%) , and obesity (42%). Patients with more advanced fibrosisscores (F3-F4) had higher comorbidity rates than patients with F0-F2. Commonlyused diagnostic tests included ultrasound (80%) , liver biopsy (78%) , AST/ALTratio (43%) , NAFLD fibrosis score (25%) , transient elastography (23%) , NAFLDliver fat score (22%) , and Fatty Liver Index (19%). Most commonly prescribedmedications were vitamin E (53%) , statins (51%) , metformin (47%) , angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (28%) , and beta blockers (22%). Medications werecommonly prescribed for reasons other than their known effects. CONCLUSION:Physicians in this study , drawn from a spectrum of practice settings , relied onultrasound and liver biopsy for diagnosis and vitamin E , statins , and metforminfor pharmacological treatment of NASH. These findings imply poor adherence toguidelines in the diagnosis and management of NAFLD and NASH. Nonalcoholicsteatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease caused by excess fat in the liver whichcan lead to liver inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) , ranging from stage F0 (noscarring) to F4 (advanced scarring). The stage of liver scarring can predict thelikelihood of future health problems , including liver failure and liver cancer.However , we do not fully understand how patient characteristics may vary atdifferent stages of liver scarring. We looked at medical information fromphysicians treating patients diagnosed with NASH to understand how patientcharacteristics might differ based on the severity of their liver scarring. Themajority (68%) of patients were stage F0-F2 , with 30% having advanced scarring(F3-F4). In addition to NASH , many patients also had type 2 diabetes , highcholesterol , high blood pressure , and obesity. Patients with more advancedscarring (F3-F4) were more likely to have these diseases than patients with lesssevere disease (F0-F2). Diagnosis of NASH by participating physicians was basedon tests including imaging (ultrasound , CT scan , MRI) , liver biopsy , blood tests ,and whether patients had other conditions that would put them at risk for NASH.The medications that the doctors prescribed most often to their patients includedvitamin E and drugs to treat high cholesterol , high blood pressure , or diabetes.Medications were frequently prescribed for reasons other than their knowneffects. By understanding how patient characteristics vary by stages of liverscarring and how NASH is currently managed may help guide the evaluation andtreatment of NASH when NASH-specific therapies become available.

AB  - Improved nutrient use efficiency together with the use of biostimulants have beenlittle explored thus far to improve fruit yield and quality in economicallyrelevant crops. The aim of this study was to determine the additive orsynergistic effects , if any , of the application of an enzyme hydrolyzed animalprotein biostimulant (Pepton) combined with priming with low nitrogen (N) in theproduction and quality of greenhouse tomatoes. Biostimulant treatment (Pepton ata dose equivalent of 4 kg/ha) was applied by ferti-irrigation for 2 months duringthe vegetative phase both in controls (watered with nutrient solution) andnutrient efficient crop (NEC) , in which plants were primed with low N by exposingthem to a 30% N deficiency for 2 months , and then recovered for 1 month beforefruit production. Foliar water and N contents , pigments , maximum PSII efficiency(Fv/Fm ratio) , and phytohormones [including abscisic acid (ABA) , salicylic acid(SA) , jasmonic acid (JA) , and cytokinins] were measured prior and at 4 and8 weeks after the first application. Fruit production and quality [as indicatedby total soluble sugars (TSS) and acidity (TA) , and the contents of lycopene ,vitamin E , and vitamin C] were measured 1 month later at harvest. Priming withlow N availability (NEC plants) doubled (p < 0.001) fruit production (due to anincrease in the number of fruits) , tended to increase (p = 0.057) by 20% theamount of TSS and increased (p < 0.05) the contents of lycopene (by 90%) andvitamin E (by 40%). Pepton displayed a tendency , almost significant , to improve(p = 0.054) total fruit production both in control and NEC plants , thus showingan additive effect to low N priming in boosting fruit production. Peptonmaintained fruit quality in terms of sugar accumulation , total acidity and thecontents of carotenoids , vitamins C and E. Pepton-related improvement in fruitproduction seemed to be related , at least partially , to an increased accumulationof cytokinins and photosynthetic pigments in leaves , which might favor vegetativevigor and ultimately fruit yield. In conclusion , Pepton application was effectivein improving the yield of greenhouse tomatoes showing additive effect with low Npriming , without negatively affecting fruit quality.

AB  - Tocopherols are lipid-soluble compounds regarded as vitamin E compounds and theyfunction as antioxidants in scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals and quenchingreactive oxygen species (ROS). In our previous studies , we isolated fivetocopherol biosynthesis genes from sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam) plantsincluding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (IbHPPD). HPPD is the firstregulatory enzyme in vitamin E biosynthesis and serves to catalyze in the firststeps α-tocopherol and plastoquinone biosynthesis by converting4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) to homogentisic acid (HGA). In this study , wegenerated transgenic sweetpotato plants overexpressing IbHPPD under the controlof cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (referred to as HP plants) viaAgrobacterium-mediated transformation to understand the function of IbHPPD insweetpotato. Three transgenic lines (HP3 , HP14 and HP15) with high transcriptlevels of IbHPPD were selected for further characterization. Compared withnon-transgenic (NT) plants , HP plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to multipleenvironmental stresses , including salt , drought , and oxidative stresses. Inaddition , HP plants showed increased tolerance to the herbicide sulcotrione ,which is involved in the inhibition of the HPPD. Interestingly , after stresstreatments , HP plants also showed higher abscisic acid (ABA) contents than NTplants. Under dehydrated condition , HP plants displayed an elevated α-tocopherolcontent to 19-27% in leaves compared with NT plants. These results indicate thatincreased abiotic stress tolerance in HP plants is related to inducingenhancement of α-tocopherol and ABA contents.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Short bowel syndrome (SBS) occurs after intestinal lossresulting in parenteral nutrition dependence and micronutrient deficiencies ,which may lead to life-limiting complications. ALC-078 is a cartridge containingimmobilized lipase that connects in-line with enteral feeding sets and digestsfats in enteral nutrition (EN). In this study , we evaluate the efficacy ofALC-078 to improve fat and nutrient absorption in a porcine SBS model. METHODS:Fifteen male Yorkshire piglets were assessed. Animals were randomized to nointestinal resection (n = 5) , 75% resection (n = 5) , or 75% resection + ALC-078(n = 5). After recovery , animals were treated for 14 days. Piglets received 60%of nutrition from continuous EN and 40% from chow. The degree of fatmalabsorption was determined by the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) followinga 72-h stool collection. Body weight , fat-soluble vitamins , and nutritionalmarkers were assessed. RESULTS: Adverse events were similar across the threegroups (P = 1.00). ALC-078-treated animals had similar weight gain compared toresected piglets. Resected animals had a lower CFA compared to unresectedcontrols (79.3% vs. 95.2% , P = 0.01) while there was no significant difference inthe ALC-078 animals (87.1% vs. 95.2% , P = 0.19). Between Study Days 1 and 15 ,ALC-078 animals had increased concentrations of vitamin D (12.2 vs. 8.7 ng/mL ,P = 0.0006) , and vitamin E (4.3 vs. 2.5 mg/L , P = 0.03). These markers did notsignificantly change in untreated resected animals. CONCLUSION: ALC-078 increasesthe absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and may improve fat malabsorption. Futurestudies should determine whether ALC-078 can reduce PN dependence and if thesefindings translate to human patients with SBS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Damage to human skin occurs either chronologically or throughrepetitive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation , where collagenphotodegradation leads to the formation of wrinkles and skin imperfections.Consequently , cosmeceutical products containing natural bioactives to restore orregenerate collagen have gained a remarkable attention as an ameliorative remedy.METHODS: This study aimed to develop and optimize collagen-loaded water-in-oilnanoemulsion (W/O NE) through a D-optimal mixture design to achieve an idealmultifunctional nanosystem containing active constituents. Vit E was included asa constituent of the formulation for its antioxidant properties to minimize thedestructive impact of UV radiation. The formulated systems were characterized interms of their globule size , optical clarity , and viscosity. An optimized systemwas selected and evaluated for its physical stability , in vitro wound healingproperties , and in vivo permeation and protection against UV radiation. Inaddition , the effect of collagen-loaded NE was compared to Vit C-loaded NE andcollagen-/Vit C-loaded NEs mixture as Vit C is known to enhance collagenproduction within the skin. RESULTS: The optimized NE was formulated with 25%oils (Vit E: safflower oil , 1:3) , 54.635% surfactant/cosurfactant (Span 80:Kolliphor EL: Arlasolve , 1:1:1) , and 20.365% water. The optimized NE loaded witheither collagen or Vit C exhibited a skin-friendly appearance with boostedpermeability , and improved cell viability and wound healing properties onfibroblast cell lines. Moreover , the in vivo study and histopathologicalinvestigations confirmed the efficacy of the developed system to protect the skinagainst UV damage. The results revealed that the effect of collagen-/Vit C-loadedNEs mixture was more pronounced , as both drugs reduced the skin damage to anextent that it was free from any detectable alterations. CONCLUSION: NEformulated using Vit E and containing collagen and/or Vit C could be a promisingameliorative remedy for skin protection against UVB irradiation.

TI  - Fat-Soluble Vitamins in Standard vs. Liposomal Form Enriched with Vitamin K2 inCystic Fibrosis: A Randomized Multi-Center Trial.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11020462 [doi]
LID - 462
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess a liposomal fat-soluble vitamin formulationcontaining vitamin K2 with standard treatment in cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Amulti-center randomized controlled trial was carried out in 100pancreatic-insufficient patients with CF. The liposomal formulation containedvitamin A as retinyl palmitate (2667 IU daily) and beta-carotene (1333 IU) , D3(4000 IU) , E (150 IU) , K1 (2 mg) , and K2 as menaquinone-7 (400 µg). It wascompared with the standard vitamin preparations in the closest possible doses(2500 IU , 1428 IU , 4000 IU , 150 IU , 2.14 mg , respectively; no vitamin K2) over 3months. RESULTS: Forty-two patients finished the trial in the liposomal and 49 inthe control group (overall 91 pts: 22.6 ± 7.6 years , 62.6% female , BMI 19.9 ± 2.8kg/m(2) , FEV1% 70% ± 30%). The main outcome was the change of vitamin status inthe serum during the study (liposomal vs. standard): all-trans-retinol (+1.48 ±95.9 vs. -43.1 ± 121.4 ng/mL , p = 0.054) , 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (+9.7 ± 13.4 vs.+2.0 ± 9.8 ng/mL , p = 0.004) , α-tocopherol (+1.5 ± 2.5 vs. -0.2 ± 1.6 µg/mL , p <0.001) , %undercarboxylated osteocalcin (-17.2 ± 24.8% vs. -8.3 ± 18.5% , p =0.061). The secondary outcome was the vitamin status at the trial end:all-trans-retinol (370.0 ± 116.5 vs. 323.1 ± 100.6 ng/mL , p = 0.045) ,25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (43.2 ± 16.6 vs. 32.7 ± 11.5 ng/mL , p < 0.001) , α-tocopherol(9.0 ± 3.1 vs. 7.7 ± 3.0 µg/mL , p = 0.037) , %undercarboxylated osteocalcin (13.0± 11.2% vs. 22.7 ± 22.0% , p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The liposomal fat-solublevitamin supplement containing vitamin K2 was superior to the standard form indelivering vitamin D3 and E in pancreatic-insufficient patients with CF. Thesupplement was also more effective in strengthening vitamin K-dependentcarboxylation , and could improve vitamin A status.

AB  - We investigated the effects of fatty acid/ monoglyceride type and amount on theabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Micelles or vesicles made with eithercaprylic acid (CA) + monocaprylin (MC) or oleic acid (OA) + monoolein (MO) at lowor high concentrations were infused in bile duct-ligated mice. Retinol + retinylester and γ-tocopherol intestinal mucosa contents were higher in mice infusedwith CA + MC than with OA + MO (up to + 350 % for vitamin A and up to + 62 % , forvitamin E; p < 0.05). Cholecalciferol intestinal mucosa content was the highestin mice infused with micelles with CA + MC at 5 mg/mL (up to + 105 % , p < 0.05).Retinyl ester plasma response was higher with mixed assemblies formed at lowconcentration of FA + MG compared to high concentration (up to + 1212 % ,p < 0.05) , while no difference in cholecalciferol and γ-tocopherol plasmaresponses were measured. No correlation between size or zeta potential andvitamin absorption was found. The impact of FA and MG on fat-soluble vitaminabsorption thus differs from one vitamin to another and should be considered toformulate adequate vitamin oral or enteral supplements.

TI  - Gluten-Free Alternative Grains: Nutritional Evaluation and Bioactive Compounds.
LID - 10.3390/foods8060208 [doi]
LID - 208
AB  - Interest in gluten-free grains is increasing , together with major incidences ofceliac disease in the last years. Since to date , knowledge of the nutritional andbioactive compounds profile of alternative gluten-free grains is limited , weevaluated the content of water-soluble (thiamine and riboflavin) and liposolublevitamins , such as carotenoids and tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) , ofgluten-free minor cereals and also of pseudocereals. The analysed samples showeda high content of bioactive compounds; in particular , amaranth , cañihua andquinoa are good sources of vitamin E , while millet , sorghum and teff (Eragrostistef , or William's Lovegrass) are good sources of thiamine. Moreover , milletprovides a fair amount of carotenoids , and in particular of lutein. These datacan provide more information on bioactive compounds in gluten-free grains. Theuse of these grains can improve the nutritional quality of gluten-freecereal-based products , and could avoid the monotony of the celiac diet.

TI  - Investigating the Potential of Transdermal Delivery of Avanafil Using VitaminE-TPGS Based Mixed Micelles Loaded Films.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13050739 [doi]
LID - 739
AB  - To avoid the first-pass metabolism of avanafil (AVA) and its altered absorptionin the presence of food after oral administration , this study aimed toinvestigate the potential of TPGS-based mixed micelle (MM)-loaded film fortransdermal delivery and the enhancement of bioavailability. A Box-Behnken designwas employed to optimize the permeation behavior of AVA from the transdermal filmacross the skin. The variables were the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of thesurfactant (X(1)) , the concentration of mixed micelles (MMs) in the film (X(2)) ,and the concentration of the permeation enhancer (X(3)). The initial permeationof AVA after 1 h (Y(1)) , and the cumulative permeation of AVA after 24 h (Y(2))were the dependent variables. Ex vivo studies were carried out on freshlyisolated rat skin to investigate the drug's permeation potential and results werevisualized using a fluorescence laser microscope. Moreover , the pharmacokineticbehavior after a single application on male Wistar rats , in comparison with filmsloaded with raw AVA , was evaluated. The results showed that the optimum factorlevels were 9.4% for the HLB of the surfactant used , and 5.12% MMs and 2.99%penetration enhancer in the film. Imaging with a fluorescence laser microscopeindicated the ability of the optimized film to deliver the payload to deeper skinlayers. Furthermore , optimized AVA-loaded TPGS-micelles film showed a significantincrease (p < 0.05) in the C(max) of AVA and the area under the AVA plasma curve(approximately three-fold). The optimized AVA-loaded TPGS-MM film thus representsa successful delivery system for enhancing the bioavailability of AVA.

AB  - Vitamin D(3) (25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD)) and vitamin E (VE) have proven to haveimmunomodulatory and antioxidant functions along with capacities to improve thereproductive function in chickens. Coccidiosis in laying hens at different stagesof growth has been shown to negatively affect performance , immune response , andoxidative status , thus increasing the cost of production. A study was conductedto evaluate the influence of dietary VD or VE on performance , gut health , immuneresponse , and oxidative status of laying hens at peak production. Laying hens (23wk-of-age , n = 225) were randomly allocated into 5 treatment groups (n = 9hens/replicate) with 5 replicate groups each: 1) unchallenged control (UC) , 2)pair-fed control (PF) , 3) challenged control (CC) , 4) challenged controltop-dressed with 5,000 IU of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD) per kg of diet , and 5)challenged control top-dressed with 100 IU of DL-α-tocopherol (VE). At 25wk-of-age , hens grouped in CC , VD , and VE were challenged with mixed Eimeria spp.to induce coccidiosis. VD or VE supplemented hens did not impact bird bodyweight; however , egg production increased by 10.36% and 13.77% , respectively (P <0.0001). Furthermore , the gut health of the hens was improved with either VD orVE supplementation , as indicated by lowered gut permeability and intestinallesion scores (P < 0.05). VE significantly reduced the heterophil count (P =0.0490) alongside numerically increasing the peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells andmonocyte counts (P > 0.05). Both VD or VE increased the TAC at 14 DPI compared toUC (P<0.05). Preliminary findings suggest that dietary VD or VE supplementationhas the potential to improve gut health , modulate the immune response , andincrease egg production in coccidiosis-infected laying hens.

PG  - 3087-3102
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S201449 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a microemulsion containingD-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS) as abiodegradable surfactant to increase the oral absorption of celecoxib. Methods:This study investigated the intestinal absorption enhancement mechanism of thismicroemulsion by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values.This study also evaluated microemulsion particle-intestine interactions in termsof release and attachment processes using confocal laser scanning microscopy(CLSM). Results: The prepared microemulsion particles had a size of <300 nm witha neutral surface charge. The celecoxib-loaded microemulsion release kinetic wasclassified as the zero-order model. This vitamin E TPGS-based microemulsionsignificantly increased the in vitro intestinal absorption of celecoxib comparedto celecoxib solution. The CLSM study suggested that microemulsion particles withentrapped drugs might attach to the intestinal epithelium before releasing theentrapped drug into tissues. The TEER value of the intestinal tissues treatedwith the celecoxib-loaded microemulsion was significantly decreased compared tothe value before treatment , indicating an increase in drug transport via theparacellular pathway. The evaluation of intestinal tissue cytotoxicity usinglactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay suggested that the preparedcelecoxib-loaded microemulsion was safe for oral route administration.Conclusions: The prepared celecoxib loaded microemulsion could increase theintestinal absorption of celecoxib compared to celecoxib solution. The intestinalabsorption enhancement mechanism of this microemulsion resulted from the increaseof the drug transport via the paracellular pathway.

TI  - Resveratrol loaded polymeric micelles for theranostic targeting of breast cancercells.
PG  - 113-124
LID - 10.7150/ntno.51955 [doi]
AB  - Treatment of breast cancer underwent extensive progress in recent years withmolecularly targeted therapies. However , non-specific pharmaceutical approaches(chemotherapy) persist , inducing severe side-effects. Phytochemicals provide apromising alternative for breast cancer prevention and treatment. Specifically ,resveratrol (res) is a plant-derived polyphenolic phytoalexin with potentbiological activity but displays poor water solubility , limiting its clinicaluse. Here we have developed a strategy for delivering res using a newlysynthesized nano-carrier with the potential for both diagnosis and treatment.Methods: Res-loaded nanoparticles were synthesized by the emulsion method usingPluronic F127 block copolymer and Vitamin E-TPGS. Nanoparticle characterizationwas performed by SEM and tunable resistive pulse sensing. EncapsulationEfficiency (EE%) and Drug Loading (DL%) content were determined by analysis ofthe supernatant during synthesis. Nanoparticle uptake kinetics in breast cancercell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 as well as in MCF-10A breast epithelial cellswere evaluated by flow cytometry and the effects of res on cell viability via MTTassay. Results: Res-loaded nanoparticles with spherical shape and a dominant sizeof 179±22 nm were produced. Res was loaded with high EE of 73±0.9% and DL contentof 6.2±0.1%. Flow cytometry revealed higher uptake efficiency in breast cancercells compared to the control. An MTT assay showed that res-loaded nanoparticlesreduced the viability of breast cancer cells with no effect on the control cells.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the newly synthesized nanoparticle isa good model for the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs. Additionally , thenanoparticle delivers a natural compound and is highly effective and selectiveagainst breast cancer cells rendering this type of nanoparticle an excellentcandidate for diagnosis and therapy of difficult to treat mammary malignancies.

TI  - Development and Characterization of Azithromycin-Loaded Microemulsions: APromising Tool for the Treatment of Bacterial Skin Infections.
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11081040 [doi]
LID - 1040
AB  - In recent years , the treatment of bacterial skin infections has been considered amajor healthcare issue due to the growing emergence of antibiotic-resistantstrains of Staphylococcus aureus. The incorporation of antibiotics in appropriatenanosystems could represent a promising strategy , able to overcome severaldrawbacks of the topical treatment of infections , including poor drug retentionwithin the skin. The present work aims to develop microemulsions containingazithromycin (AZT) , a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic. Firstly , AZTsolubility in various oils , surfactants and co-surfactants was assessed to selectthe main components. Subsequently , microemulsions composed of vitamin E acetate ,Labrasol(®) and Transcutol(®) P were prepared and characterized for their pH ,viscosity , droplet size , zeta potential and ability to release the drug and topromote its retention inside porcine skin. Antimicrobial activity against S.aureus methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) and the biocompatibility ofmicroemulsions were evaluated. Microemulsions showed an acceptable pH and werecharacterized by different droplet sizes and viscosities depending on theircomposition. Interestingly , they provided a prolonged release of AZT and promotedits accumulation inside the skin. Finally , microemulsions retained AZT efficacyon MRSA and were not cytotoxic. Hence , the developed AZT-loaded microemulsionscould be considered as useful nanocarriers for the treatment ofantibiotic-resistant infections of the skin.

TI  - High Oxidation Stability of Tea Polyphenol-stabilized Highly Crosslinked UHMWPEUnder an in Vitro Aggressive Oxidative Condition.
PG  - 1947-1955
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000000771 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synovial fluid components , especially lipids , can trigger oxidationof ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) artificial joint componentsin vivo. The use of antioxidants such as vitamin E effectively diminishes theoxidative cascade by capturing free radicals and reducing the oxidation potentialof UHMWPE implants. Using a thermo-oxidative aging method , we recently found thattea polyphenols can enhance the oxidation resistance of irradiated UHMWPE incomparison with commercial vitamin E. However , it is yet unknown whether teapolyphenols can reduce lipid-induced oxidation. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We exploredwhether tea polyphenol-stabilized UHMWPE would exhibit (1) lower squaleneabsorption; (2) stronger oxidation resistance; and (3) lower content of freeradicals than vitamin E-stabilized UHMWPE under a physiologically-motivated invitro accelerated-aging model. METHODS: Tea polyphenol (lipid-solubleepigallocatechin gallate [lsEGCG]) and vitamin E were blended with UHMWPE powdersfollowed by compression molding and electron beam irradiation at 100 and 150 kGy.Small cubes (n = 3 , 60 mg , 4 × 4 × 4 mm) cut from the blocks were doped insqualene at 60° , 80° , 100° , and 120° C for 2 hours. Gravimetric change of thecubes after squalene immersion was measured to assess absorption. Thin films (n =3 , ∼60 μm) were also microtomed from the blocks and were doped at 120° C for 24hours. Oxidation induction time (n = 3 , 5 mg of material from the cubes) andincipient oxidation temperature (n = 3 , thin films) were obtained to determinethe oxidation stability. Signal intensity of the free radicals , obtained byelectron spin resonance spectroscopy , was used to qualitatively rank theantioxidant ability of vitamin E and lsEGCG. RESULTS: Squalene absorption wascomparable between lsEGCG/UHMWPE and vitamin E/UHMWPE at a given temperature andradiation dose. The oxidation induction time of 100 kGy-irradiated UHMWPE wasincreased with lsEGCG compared with vitamin E except at 120° C. For example , theoxidation induction time value of 100 kGy-irradiated lsEGCG/UHMWPE immersed at 60C was 25.3 minutes (24.2-27.8 minutes) , which was 8.3 minutes longer than that of100 kGy-irradiated vitamin E/UHMWPE which was 17.0 minutes (15.0-17.1 minutes) (p= 0.040). After squalene immersion at 120° C , the incipient oxidation temperatureof 100 and 150 kGy irradiated lsEGCG/UHMWPE was 234° C (227-240° C) and 227° C(225-229° C) , which was higher than vitamin E-stabilized counterparts with valueof 217° C (214-229° C; p = 0.095) and 216° C (207-218° C; p = 0.040) ,respectively. The electron spin resonance signal of 150 kGy irradiatedlsEGCG/UHMWPE was qualitatively weaker than that of 150 kGy irradiated vitaminE/UHMWPE. CONCLUSIONS: lsEGCG-stabilized UHMWPE demonstrated higher oxidationresistance than vitamin E-stabilized UHMWPE after squalene immersion , likelybecause lsEGCG donates more protons to eliminate macroradicals than vitamin E.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our in vitro findings provide support that lsEGCG may beeffective in protecting against oxidation that may be associated with synovialfluid-associated oxidation of highly crosslinked UHMWPE joint replacementcomponents.

TI  - Associations of fat-soluble micronutrients and redox biomarkers with frailtystatus in the FRAILOMIC initiative.
PG  - 1339-1346
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.12479 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A poor fat-soluble micronutrient (FMN) and a high oxidative stressstatus are associated with frailty. Our aim was to determine the cross-sectionalassociation of FMNs and oxidative stress biomarkers [protein carbonyls (PrCarb)and 3-nitrotyrosine] with the frailty status in participants older than 65 years.METHODS: Plasma levels of vitamins A (retinol) , D(3)  , E (α-tocopherol andγ-tocopherol) and carotenoids (α-carotene and β-carotene , lycopene ,lutein/zeaxanthin , and β-cryptoxanthin) , PrCarb , and 3-nitrotyrosine weremeasured in 1450 individuals of the FRAILOMIC initiative. Participants wereclassified into robust , pre-frail , and frail using Fried's frailty criteria.Associations between biomarkers and frailty status were assessed by generallinear and logistic regression models , both adjusted for cohort , season of bloodsampling , gender , age , height , weight , and smoking. RESULTS: Robust participantshad significantly higher vitamin D(3) and lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations thanpre-frail and frail subjects; had significantly higher γ-tocopherol , α-carotene ,β-carotene , lycopene , and β-cryptoxanthin concentrations than frail subjects , andhad significantly lower PrCarb concentrations than frail participants inmultivariate linear models. Frail subjects were more likely to be in the lowestthan in the highest tertile for vitamin D(3) (adjusted odds ratio: 2.15; 95%confidence interval: 1.42-3.26) , α-tocopherol (2.12; 1.39-3.24) , α-carotene(1.69; 1.00-2.88) , β-carotene (1.84; 1.13-2.99) , lycopene (1.94; 1.24-3.05) ,lutein/zeaxanthin (3.60; 2.34-5.53) , and β-cryptoxanthin (3.02; 1.95-4.69) andwere more likely to be in the highest than in the lowest tertile for PrCarb(2.86; 1.82-4.49) than robust subjects in multivariate regression models.CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that both low FMN and high PrCarb concentrationsare associated with pre-frailty and frailty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Daily antenatal multiple micronutrient (MM) compared with iron folicacid (IFA) supplementation from early pregnancy improved birth outcomes andmaternal micronutrient status in rural Bangladesh , but effects on newborn statusare unknown. OBJECTIVE: We examined cord blood micronutrient biomarkers inrelation to antenatal MM and IFA supplementation and maternal gestationalmicronutrient status in rural Bangladeshi newborns. DESIGN: In a double-blinded ,cluster-randomized trial of antenatal IFA or MM (with the same IFA content) , weanalyzed cord blood plasma from 333 singleton births , and corresponding maternalplasma at 32.5 ± 2.6 wk of gestation , for ferritin (iron stores) , folate ,cobalamin (vitamin B-12) , retinol (vitamin A) , 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D ,vitamin D status] , α-tocopherol (vitamin E) , zinc , thyroglobulin , and freethyroxine (iodine status). Intervention effects and associations were determinedusing linear regression , exploring maternal status as a mediator of interventioneffects on cord biomarkers. RESULTS: The MM intervention increased cord ferritin(mean: +12.4%; 95% CI: 1.3 , 24.6%) , 25(OH)D (mean: +14.7%; 95% CI: 4.8 , 25.6%) ,and zinc (mean: +5.8%; 95% CI: 1.0 , 10.8%). Cord folate (mean: +26.8%; 95% CI:19.6 , 34.5%) , cobalamin (mean: +31.3%; 95% CI: 24.6 , 38.3%) , 25(OH)D (mean:+26.7%; 95% CI: 23.2 , 30.3%) , α-tocopherol (mean: +8.7%; 95% CI: 3.6 , 13.7%) ,zinc (mean: +2.3%; 95% CI: 0.5 , 4.2%) , thyroglobulin (mean: +20.1%; 95% CI: 9.0 ,32.2%) and thyroxine (mean: +1.5%; 95% CI: 0.0 , 3.0%) increased per 1-SDincrement in maternal status (all P < 0.05); ferritin and retinol changedby +2.0%; 95% CI: -8.9 , 14.3%; P = 0.72; and +3.5%; 95% CI: -0.4 , 7.3%; P = 0.07 ,respectively. Ferritin , folate , cobalamin , zinc , and thyroglobulin averaged1.57-6.75 times higher and retinol , α-tocopherol , and 25(OH)D 0.30-0.84 timeslower in cord than maternal plasma , suggesting preferential maternal-fetaltransfer of iron , folate , cobalamin , and zinc; limited transfer of fat-solublevitamins; and high fetal iodine demand. CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal MM supplementationincreased newborn ferritin , 25(OH)D , and zinc , while maternal and newborn folate ,vitamins B-12 , D , and E , zinc , and iodine biomarkers were positively related.Despite limited effects of MM , better maternal micronutrient status wasassociated with improved micronutrient status of Bangladeshi newborns. This trialwas registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00860470.

AB  - A 61-year-old alcoholic male with history of cholecystectomy presented with a20-year history of recurrent bowel obstruction and a 30 lb weight loss. Afternumerous attempts at conservative management , exploratory laparotomy wasperformed , which showed no mechanical cause. Despite no clear etiology , theobstruction persisted and intensified. A follow-up computed tomography scanrevealed a small bowel obstruction with concurrent megacolon. A total abdominalcolectomy was performed , with ileostomy. Grossly , there was intestinal dilationup to 15 cm with prominent brown discoloration of bowel wall. No strictures orother fixed obstruction were identified. Microscopic examination revealedprominent lipofuscin-like pigment deposition , involving the muscularis propria ,muscularis mucosae , and vascular smooth muscle. Histochemical staining waspositive for periodic acid-Schiff and negative for iron and calcium , consistentwith lipofuscin. The gross and histologic findings fit with brown bowel syndrome.Brown bowel syndrome is a very rare condition characterized by lipofuscindeposits predominantly within the smooth muscle of the muscularis mucosae and/ormuscularis propria that imparts a brown color to the bowel. It is generallythought to be a smooth muscle mitochondrial myopathy due to chronic vitamin Edeficiency secondary to fat malabsorption syndromes , resulting in free radicalscausing peroxidation of unsaturated membrane lipids with accumulation oflipofuscin. Brown bowel syndrome may be seen in patients with alcohol abuse ,maldigestion , chronic bowel inflammation , and intestinal lymphangiectasia. Ourpatient's severe chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction , low levels of certainfat-soluble vitamins (A , D , and E) , significant weight loss and history ofcholecystectomy with alcohol abuse correlates with brown bowel syndromeclinically.

TI  - Encapsulating Halofuginone Hydrobromide in TPGS Polymeric Micelles EnhancesEfficacy Against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.
PG  - 1587-1600
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S289096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Halofuginone hydrobromide (HF) is a synthetic analogue of thenaturally occurring quinazolinone alkaloid febrifugine , which has potentialtherapeutic effects against breast cancer , however , its poor water solubilitygreatly limits its pharmaceutical application. D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol1000 succinate (TPGS) is a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E , which canself-assemble to form polymeric micelles (PMs) for encapsulating insolubleanti-tumor drugs , thereby effectively enhancing their anti-cancer effects.METHODS: HF-loaded TPGS PMs (HTPMs) were manufactured using a thin-film hydrationtechnique , followed by a series of characterizations , including the hydrodynamicdiameter (HD) , zeta potential (ZP) , stability , drug loading (DL) , encapsulationefficiency (EE) , and in vitro drug release. The anti-cancer effects and potentialmechanism of HTPMs were investigated in the breast cell lines MDA-MB-231 andMCF-7 , and normal breast epithelial cell line Eph-ev. The breast cancer-bearingBALB/c nude mouse model was successfully established by subcutaneous injection ofMDA-MB-231 cells and used to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic effect and safetyof the HTPMs. RESULTS: The optimized HTPMs had an HD of 17.8±0.5 nm and ZP of14.40±0.1 mV. These PMs exhibited DL of 12.94 ± 0.46% and EE of 90.6 ± 0.85% ,along with excellent storage stability , dilution tolerance and sustained drugrelease in pH-dependent manner within 24 h compared to free HF. Additionally , theHTPMs had stronger inhibitory effects than free HF and paclitaxel againstMDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells , and little toxicity in normalbreast epithelial Eph-ev cells. The HTPMs induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosisof MDA-MB-231 by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential and enhancingreactive oxygen species formation. Evaluation of in vivo anti-tumor efficacydemonstrated that HTPMs exerted a stronger tumor inhibition rate (68.17%) thanfree HF , and exhibited excellent biocompatibility. CONCLUSION: The findings fromthis study indicate that HTPMs holds great clinical potential for treatingtriple-negative breast cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of vitamin E , pioglitazone , sodium-glucosecotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors , and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptoragonists in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). DESIGN: Anetwork meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , and Web ofScience databases from their inception until September 1 , 2021. ELIGIBILITYCRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing theeffects of four different drugs in patients with NAFLD were included. Allsuperiority , non-inferiority , phase II and III , non-blinded , single-blinded , anddouble-blinded trials were included. Interventions of interest included vitamin E(α-tocopherol and δ-tocotrienol) , pioglitazone , three kinds of GLP-1 receptoragonists (liraglutide , semaglutide , and dulaglutide) , four SGLT2 inhibitors(dapagliflozin , empagliflozin , ipragliflozin , and tofogliflozin) , and comparisonsof these different drugs , and placebos. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomemeasures included changes in non-invasive tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ,aspartate aminotransferase (AST) , gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) , controlledattenuation parameter (CAP) , enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score , liver fatcontent (LFC) , and keratin-18 (K-18)] and invasive tests [fibrosis score andresolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)]. RESULTS: Twenty-seven trialsincluding 3,416 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Results referto vitamin E , pioglitazone , GLP-1 receptor agonists , and SGLT2 inhibitors. First ,placebos were used as a reference. δ-Tocotrienol was superior to placebo indecreasing the GGT level. Semaglutide , ipragliflozin , and pioglitazone induced asignificantly higher decrease in the ALT level than a placebo. Semaglutide ,pioglitazone , and dapagliflozin were superior to placebo in decreasing the ASTlevel. Tofogliflozin and pioglitazone induced a significantly higher decrease inthe K-18 level than a placebo. Liraglutide was superior to placebo in decreasingCAP. Liraglutide , pioglitazone , and vitamin E induced a significantly higherincrease in resolution of NASH than a placebo. As for pairwise comparisons ,semaglutide and pioglitazone were superior to liraglutide in decreasing the ALTlevel. Semaglutide induced a significantly higher decrease in the ALT level thandulaglutide. Semaglutide was obviously superior to empagliflozin , liraglutide ,dulaglutide , and tofogliflozin in decreasing the AST level. Pioglitazone induceda significantly higher decrease in the GGT level than ipragliflozin.δ-Tocotrienol was superior to liraglutide in decreasing the GGT level.Tofogliflozin and pioglitazone induced a significantly higher decrease in theK-18 level than dulaglutide. Pioglitazone was superior to vitamin E in increasingthe resolution of NASH. Furthermore , liraglutide treatment had the highest SUCRAranking in decreasing CAP and ELF scores and increasing the resolution of NASH.Pioglitazone treatment had the highest SUCRA ranking in decreasing LFC andfibrosis scores. Tofogliflozin treatment had the highest SUCRA ranking indecreasing K-18 , while dapagliflozin treatment had the highest SUCRA ranking indecreasing the GGT level. Semaglutide treatment had the highest SUCRA ranking indecreasing the levels of ALT and AST. CONCLUSION: The network meta-analysisprovided evidence for the efficacy of vitamin E , pioglitazone , SGLT2 inhibitors ,and GLP-1 receptor agonists in treating patients with NAFLD. To find the bestguide-level drugs , it is necessary to include more RCTs with these off-labeldrugs , so that patients and clinicians can make optimal decisions together.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero , identifier:CRD42021283129.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the prevalence of dry eye syndrome among Korean womenaged 40 and above and explore the correlation between the syndrome and dailydietary nutrient intake. We analyzed data from 92,888 female participants (meanage: 63.35 ± 8.86 years) from the 8th Korea National Health and NutritionExamination Survey (KNHANES 2019). Dietary intake was evaluated using apersonalized 24 h recall method for 21 nutrients , including macronutrients ,macro- and micro-minerals , and both water- and fat-soluble vitamins. Associationsbetween nutrient intake and dry eye syndrome were determined using odds ratiosfrom multivariate logistic regression. We found a 7.7% prevalence of dry eyesyndrome in the population studied. Intake of dietary fiber (adjusted OR: 0.72) ,protein (adjusted OR: 0.84) , omega-3 fatty acids (adjusted OR: 0.90) , water(adjusted OR: 0.76) , calcium (adjusted OR: 0.82) , phosphate (adjusted OR: 0.87) ,potassium (adjusted OR: 0.88) , magnesium (adjusted OR: 0.87) , vitamin A (adjustedOR: 0.78) , vitamin C (adjusted OR: 0.73) , and vitamin E (adjusted OR: 0.86) wasinversely associated with dry eye syndrome prevalence (p < 0.0001 for all).Conversely , a higher intake of carbohydrates (adjusted OR: 1.23) , sugar (adjustedOR: 1.30) , fat (adjusted OR: 1.25) , cholesterol (adjusted OR: 1.32) , sodium(adjusted OR: 1.18) , iron (adjusted OR: 1.28) , and zinc (adjusted OR: 1.26)correlated with an increased risk (p < 0.0001 for all). No significantassociations were found between the prevalence of dry eye syndrome and the intakeof omega-6 fatty acids and vitamin D. Our study identified significantassociations between specific dietary nutrients and the risk of dry eye syndromeamong Korean women aged 40 and above. These findings suggest that dietary choicescould influence the likelihood of developing dry eye syndrome , indicating apotential role for dietary intervention in its management. However , it isimportant to note that these observations are preliminary , and further researchis necessary to confirm these relationships and explore their implications fordietary recommendations in dry eye syndrome prevention and management.

LID - 100568
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the nutritional value of five commercialmeal-replacement shakes , and mainly focused on the lipid digestion fates andfat-soluble vitamin bioavailability. Four out of five samples exhibited a lowlipolysis level (37.33-61.42%) , aligning with the intended objectives of theseproducts. Although the remaining sample rich in diacylglycerol (DAG) had a higherlipolysis level (80.83%) , the inherent low-calorie nature of DAG might compensatefor this drawback. The release level of individual fatty acid was largelydetermined by the glycerolipid composition. Moreover , the strong positivecorrelation between lipid hydrolyzed products amounts and the fat-soluble vitaminbioavailability was observed. Surprisingly , one out of five samples can provideenough vitamin A and vitamin E for consumers as a total replacement of one or tworegular meals. Consequently , the meal-replacement shakes hold the potential toemerge as healthy products for this fast-paced era if the composition andstructure were carefully designed and calculated.

TI  - The beneficial effects of alpha-tocopherol on intestinal function and theexpression of tight junction proteins in differentiated segments of the intestinein piglets.
PG  - 677-687
LID - 10.1002/fsn3.3103 [doi]
AB  - Alpha (α)-tocopherol is a major component of dietary vitamin E. Despite being oneof the most widely used food supplements in both animals and humans , its role inintestinal functions remains unknown. We were able to examine and accuratelydemonstrate its permeability effect in vitro and its differentiated effect ontight junction expression in different segments of the intestine in vivo usingcultured intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) and piglets. Acultured IPEC-J2 demonstrated that α-tocopherol upregulated the expression oftight junction proteins and improved their integrity , with a maximum effect atconcentrations ranging from 20 to 40 μmol/L. In vivo data from weaned pigs feddifferent doses of α-tocopherol for 2 weeks revealed that α-tocopheroleffectively increases the expression of tight junction proteins in all sectionsof the intestinal mucosa , with the highest effect on the duodenum at an optimumdose of 20-50 mg/kg. In contrast , α-tocopherol did not affect intestinalinflammation. These findings suggest that α-tocopherol maintains intestinalintegrity and increases the expression of tight junction proteins both in vitroand in vivo.

TI  - A Role for Tocopherol Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis Basal Immunity to BacterialInfection.
PG  - 1008-1028
LID - 10.1104/pp.19.00618 [doi]
AB  - Tocopherols are lipid-soluble antioxidants synthesized in plastids of plants andother photosynthetic organisms. The four known tocopherols , α- , β- , γ- , andδ-tocopherol , differ in number and position of methyl groups on their chromanolhead group. In unstressed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves , α-tocopherolconstitutes the main tocopherol form , whereas seeds predominantly containγ-tocopherol. Here , we show that inoculation of Arabidopsis leaves with thebacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae induces the expression of genes involvedin early steps of tocopherol biosynthesis and triggers strong accumulation ofγ-tocopherol , moderate production of δ-tocopherol , and generation of thebenzoquinol precursors of tocopherols. The pathogen-inducible biosynthesis oftocopherols is promoted by the immune regulators ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1and PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4. In addition , tocopherols accumulate in response tobacterial flagellin and reactive oxygen species. By quantifying tocopherol formsin inoculated wild-type plants and biosynthetic pathway mutants , we providebiochemical insights into the pathogen-inducible tocopherol pathway. Notably ,vitamin E deficient2 (vte2) mutant plants , which are compromised in bothtocopherol and benzoquinol precursor accumulation , exhibit increasedsusceptibility toward compatible P. syringae and possess heightened levels ofmarkers of lipid peroxidation after bacterial infection. The deficiency oftriunsaturated fatty acids in vte2-1 fatty acid desaturase3-2 (fad3-2) fad7-2fad8 quadruple mutants prevents increased lipid peroxidation in the vte2background and restores pathogen resistance to wild-type levels. Therefore , thetocopherol biosynthetic pathway positively influences salicylic acid accumulationand guarantees effective basal resistance of Arabidopsis against compatible P.syringae , possibly by protecting leaves from the pathogen-induced oxidation oftrienoic fatty acid-containing lipids.

LID - 10.3390/molecules24244517 [doi]
LID - 4517
AB  - Avocado (a fruit that represents a billion-dollar industry) has become a relevantcrop in global trade. The benefits of eating avocados have also been thoroughlydescribed as they contain important nutrients needed to ensure biologicalfunctions. For example , avocados contain considerable amounts of vitamins andother phytonutrients , such as carotenoids (e.g. , β-carotene) , which arefat-soluble. Hence , there is a need to assess accurately these types ofcompounds. Herein we describe a method that chromatographically separatescommercial standard solutions containing both fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin Aacetate and palmitate , Vitamin D(2) and D(3) , vitamin K(1) , α- , δ- , and γ-vitaminE isomers) and carotenoids (β-cryptoxanthin , zeaxanthin , lutein , β-carotene , andlycopene) effectively (i.e. , analytical recoveries ranging from 80.43% to117.02% , for vitamins , and from 43.80% to 108.63%). We optimized saponificationconditions and settled at 80 °C using 1 mmol KOH L(-1) ethanol during 1 h. Weused a non-aqueous gradient that included methanol and methyl tert-butyl ether(starting at an 80:20 ratio) and a C(30) chromatographic column to achieveanalyte separation (in less than 40 min) and applied this method to avocado , afruit that characteristically contains both types of compounds. We obtained amethod with good linearity at the mid to low range of the mg L(-1) (determinationcoefficients 0.9006-0.9964). To determine both types of compounds in avocado , wedeveloped and validated for the simultaneous analysis of carotenoids andfat-soluble vitamins based on liquid chromatography and single quadrupole massdetection (LC/MS). From actual avocado samples , we found relevant concentrationsfor cholecalciferol (ranging from 103.5 to 119.5) , δ-tocopherol (ranging from6.16 to 42.48) , and lutein (ranging from 6.41 to 15.13 mg/100 g dry weightbasis). Simmonds cultivar demonstrated the higher values for all analytes(ranging from 0.03 (zeaxanthin) to 119.5 (cholecalciferol) mg/100 g dry weightbasis).

AB  - The effect of the antioxidant activity of α-tocopherol incorporated intodifferent carriers on the oxidative stability of oil in water emulsion wasinvestigated. The antioxidant activity of free and encapsulated α-tocopherol wasmeasured in a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl reaction. Apart from α-tocopherolmicelles , the samples showed similar antioxidant activity. The number of primaryoxidation products in the emulsion with tocopherol liposomes and niosomes waslower than in the emulsion with micelles. During storage , the lipid peroxidesgradually increased , whereas in emulsion with no α-tocopherol carriers added theyremained constant. The content of the conjugated dienes first increased , andafter 14 days at the end of testing time it remained stable in both types ofemulsions. Our results might suggest that α-tocopherol when encapsulated intocarriers exhibits lower antioxidant activity. The results obtained could be dueto the better solubility of α-tocopherol in lipid droplets and thus the loweravailability for the interfacial region , which is thought to be the place of themost pronounced lipid oxidation.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) promotes liverinjury and inflammation. Treatment with vitamin E (α-tocopherol , αT) , alipid-soluble antioxidant , improves liver injury but also decreases steatosis ,thought to be upstream of OS , through an unknown mechanism. To elucidate themechanism , we combined a mechanistic human trial interrogating pathways ofintrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) accumulation and in vitro experiments. 50% ofNAFLD patients (n = 20) treated with αT (200-800 IU/d) for 24 weeks had a ≥ 25%relative decrease in IHTG by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Paired liverbiopsies at baseline and week 4 of treatment revealed a decrease in markers ofhepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) that strongly predicted week 24 response. Invitro , using HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes , αT inhibitedglucose-induced DNL by decreasing SREBP-1 processing and lipogenic geneexpression. This mechanism is dependent on the antioxidant capacity of αT , asredox-silenced methoxy-αT is unable to inhibit DNL in vitro. OS by itself wassufficient to increase S2P expression in vitro , and S2P is upregulated in NAFLDlivers. In summary , we utilized αT to demonstrate a vicious cycle in which NAFLDgenerates OS , which feeds back to augment DNL and increases steatosis.Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01792115.

TI  - Dietary Intake during 56 Weeks of a Low-Fat Diet for Lomitapide Treatment inJapanese Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 72-83
LID - 10.5551/jat.44107 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Lomitapide is an oral inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transferprotein used to treat homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH); patientsrequire a low-fat diet to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects and dietarysupplements to prevent nutrient deficiencies. We investigated the diet andnutritional status during lomitapide treatment. METHODS: Japanese patients withHoFH , who were in a phase 3 trial of lomitapide , were instructed to start low-fatdiets with supplements of vitamin E and essential fatty acids 6 weeks beforestarting lomitapide treatment. Dietary education was conducted by registereddietitians 16 times during the study period , which included a pre-treatmentrun-in phase (Weeks －6-0) , a lomitapide treatment efficacy phase (Weeks 0-26) anda safety phase (Weeks 26-56). Two-day dietary records were collected at eachdietary counseling session. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters weremeasured at Weeks 0 , 26 and 56. RESULTS: Eight patients completed the 56 weeks oflomitapide treatment. Their median energy intakes derived from lipids were 19.2%and 17.9% during the efficacy and safety phases , respectively. "Fats and oils"intakes , and "Fatty meat and poultry" intakes in two patients , were successfullyreduced to achieve low-fat diets. Although intakes of energy , fatty acids andfat-soluble vitamins did not differ significantly among phases , body weight ,serum fatty acid levels and vitamin E concentrations were decreased at Week 26 ascompared with Week 0. CONCLUSION: HoFH patients can adhere to low-fat diets withongoing dietary counseling. Instructions about intakes of energy , fatty acids andfat-soluble vitamins , as well as periodic evaluations of nutritional status , arenecessary.

LID - 10.3390/nu13020669 [doi]
LID - 669
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) is common practice inpatients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). We aimed to describe the rate ofONS use to assess their contribution to dietary intake and to determine if theyare associated with respiratory status , body composition , muscle strength , bonemineral density (BMD) , bone remodeling biomarkers , and plasmatic levels ofvitamins. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Patients were clinically stable adultsrecruited from the CF unit. A 4-day prospective dietary questionnaire wasconducted; in addition to respiratory variables , body composition , and BMD(through densitometry , DXA) , muscle strength (JAMAR dynamometer) , fat-solublevitamins , and bone remodeling biomarkers (vitamins A , D , and E; osteocalcin , OC;undercarboxylated osteocalcin , ucOC; degradation of the C-terminal telopeptidesof type I collagen , CTX; and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand ,RANKL) were also evaluated. RESULTS: The study included 59 subjects with CF(57.6% female , mean age 29.3 ± 9.4 years , and BMI 22.0 ± 3.6 kg/m(2)). In thisstudy , 22% (13) patients were taking ONS and presented , compared with those nottaking them , significantly more total and mild exacerbations and lower BMI;moreover , they showed a significantly higher total daily calorie intake inaddition to a higher consumption of carbohydrates , proteins , and lipids per kg ofbody weight , omega-3 fatty acids , and vitamins A , D , and E. Vitamin E plasmaticlevels were significantly higher in the group on ONS , as was the case with RANKL;finally , a lower rate of vitamin D deficiency was also found. CONCLUSIONS: ONSwere used by patients with worse respiratory and nutritional statuses and theiruse was associated with a higher intake of macro- and micronutrients and withbetter plasmatic levels of fat-soluble vitamins.

AB  - Despite widespread use as an immunosuppressant , the therapeutic efficacy of theundecapeptide cyclosporine A (CyA) is compromised when given by the oral routebecause of the innate hydrophobicity of the drug molecule , potentially leading topoor aqueous solubility and bioavailability. The aim of this study was to developand characterize nanofibers based on the water-miscible polymerpolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) , incorporating CyA preloaded into polymericsurfactants so as to promote micelle formation on hydration; therefore , thisapproach represents the novel combination of three dissolution enhancementmethodologies , namely solid dispersion technology , micellar systems , andnanofibers with enhanced surface area. The preparation of the nanofibers wasperformed in two steps. First , mixed micelles composed of the water-solublevitamin E derivative d-α-tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol) 1000 succinate and theamphiphilic triblock polymer Pluronic F127 (Poloxamer 407) were prepared. Themicelles were characterized in terms of size , surface charge , drug loading , andencapsulation efficiency using transmission electron microscopy , dynamic lightscattering , Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy , high-performance liquidchromatography , and scanning electron and atomic force microscopy analysis.Nanofibers composed of PVP and the drug-loaded surfactant system were thenprepared via electrospinning , with accompanying thermal , spectroscopic , andsurface topological analysis. Dissolution studies indicated an extremely rapiddissolution profile for the fibers compared to the drug alone , while wettabilitystudies also indicated a marked decrease in contact angle compared to the drugalone. Overall , the new approach appears to offer a viable means for considerablyimproving the dissolution of the hydrophobic peptide CyA , with associatedimplications for improved oral bioavailability.

TI  - TAT1 and TAT2 tyrosine aminotransferases have both distinct and shared functionsin tyrosine metabolism and degradation in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 3563-3576
LID - 10.1074/jbc.RA118.006539 [doi]
AB  - Plants produce various l-tyrosine (Tyr)-derived compounds that are critical forplant adaptation and have pharmaceutical or nutritional importance for humanhealth. Tyrosine aminotransferases (TATs) catalyze the reversible reactionbetween Tyr and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) , representing the entry point inplants for both biosynthesis of various natural products and Tyr degradation inthe recycling of energy and nutrients. To better understand the roles of TATs andhow Tyr is metabolized in planta , here we characterized single and doubleloss-of-function mutants of TAT1 (At5g53970) and TAT2 (At5g36160) in the modelplant Arabidopsis thaliana As reported previously , tat1 mutants exhibitedelevated and decreased levels of Tyr and tocopherols , respectively. The tat2mutation alone had no impact on Tyr and tocopherol levels , but a tat1 tat2 doublemutant had increased Tyr accumulation and decreased tocopherol levels underhigh-light stress compared with the tat1 mutant. Relative to WT and the tat2mutant , the tat1 mutant displayed increased vulnerability to continuous darktreatment , associated with an early drop in respiratory activity and sucrosedepletion. During isotope-labeled Tyr feeding in the dark , we observed that thetat1 mutant exhibits much slower (13)C incorporation into tocopherols , fumarate ,and other tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates than WT and the tat2mutant. These results indicate that TAT1 and TAT2 function together in tocopherolbiosynthesis , with TAT2 having a lesser role , and that TAT1 plays the major rolein Tyr degradation in planta Our study also highlights the importance of Tyrdegradation under carbon starvation conditions during dark-induced senescence inplants.

PG  - 6045-6058
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkz360 [doi]
AB  - We determined the effect of attaching palmitate , tocopherol or cholesterol to PSASOs and their effects on plasma protein binding and on enhancing ASO potency inthe muscle of rodents and monkeys. We found that cholesterol ASO conjugatesshowed 5-fold potency enhancement in the muscle of rodents relative tounconjugated ASOs. However , they were toxic in mice and as a result were notevaluated in the monkey. In contrast , palmitate and tocopherol-conjugated ASOsshowed enhanced potency in the skeletal muscle of rodents and modest enhancementsin potency in the monkey. Analysis of the plasma-protein binding profiles of theASO-conjugates by size-exclusion chromatography revealed distinct andspecies-specific differences in their association with plasma proteins whichlikely rationalizes their behavior in animals. Overall , our data suggest thatmodulating binding to plasma proteins can influence ASO activity and distributionto extra-hepatic tissues in a species-dependent manner and sets the stage toidentify other strategies to enhance ASO potency in muscle tissues.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of distinct production systemsand seasonal variation in the Brazilian Eastern Amazon on the meat lipidcomposition of water buffaloes. Water buffaloes were reared in commercial farmsin the Eastern Amazon either in extensive systems (Marajó Island , Nova Timboteuaand Santarém locations) , during rainy or dry seasons , or intensive (feedlot)systems. Animals reared in extensive systems were fed natural pastures , and thosereared in feedlots were fed sorghum silage and commercial pellets. Buffaloes wereslaughtered and ribeye muscle (longissimus lumborum) samples collected.Lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamins and fatty acids were analyzed. The nutritionalvalue of meat from buffaloes reared in Marajó Island extensive system during therainy season was higher than that of other systems , as it had lower levels ofcholesterol and higher amounts of α-tocopherol associated with higherhypocholesterolaemic/hypercholesterolaemic ratio and lower index of atherogenic.Also , this meat had lower percentages of saturated fatty acids and higherproportions of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) , particularly n-3PUFA , with increased PUFA/saturated fatty acids ratio and decreased n-6/n-3 PUFAratio. However , all extensive systems produced meat with a relatively low indexof thrombogenicity values , which is advantageous for human health.

TI  - Potentiating the Cytotoxic Activity of a Novel Simvastatin-Loaded Cubosomeagainst Breast Cancer Cells: Insights on Dual Cell Death via Ferroptosis andApoptosis.
PG  - 675-689
LID - 10.2147/BCTT.S336712 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Female breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide. Emergingevidence shows that simvastatin (SIM) has promising anticancer activities.However , the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Increasing reportsimply statins can modulate ferroptosis through disrupting reactive oxygen species(ROS) and glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GPX4) levels. However , whetherferroptosis contributes to SIM anticancer activity , especially regarding GPX4 isunclear. Moreover , poor aqueous SIM solubility hinders its delivery in adequatelevels to tumor sites. Meanwhile , cubosomes are biocompatible nanocarriers thatenhance lipophilic drug delivery. Therefore , in this study , we formulated a novelSIM-loaded cubosome (SIM-CB) and analyzed its cytotoxic activity on MCF-7 cancercells in comparison with free SIM. METHODS: The present study tested thecytotoxic activity of SIM-CB on MCF-7 cells , in comparison with SIM usingsulphorhodamine assay. We analyzed SIM-CB effect on apoptosis and cell cycleusing flowcytometry , and investigated its effect on Bcl-2 , caspase 3 , ROS ,reduced glutathione (GSH) , lipid peroxides and GPX4 enzyme. Finally , we testedthe persistence of SIM-CB apoptosis and ferroptosis activities on MCF-7 cells inpresence of vitamin E , a potent antioxidant and ferroptosis inhibitor. RESULTS:SIM-CB was successfully formulated at the nano size. SIM-CB significantlyincreased simvastatin therapeutic activity , with IC(50) of SIM-CB 52% lower thanSIM. 95% CI [1.8 , 2.7] , SD = 0.34 for SIM-CB , and [4.1 , 5.2] , SD = 0.45 for SIM.Compared with free SIM , SIM-CB doubled total deaths and increased apoptosis (p <0.05). Moreover , SIM-CB remarkably increased caspase-3 , ROS , and lipid peroxidelevels but decreased antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein , GSH , and GPX4 compared withfree SIM. Notably , SIM-CB elicited a high distinguished resistance against theinhibitory effects of vitamin E. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge , thisstudy is the first to present SIM-CB as a promising means to enhancing thetherapeutic potential of simvastatin against breast cancer cells , throughpotentiating both apoptosis and ferroptosis.

TI  - Reactive Oxygen Species Production Is Responsible for Antineoplastic Activity ofOsmium , Ruthenium , Iridium and Rhodium Half-Sandwich Type Complexes withBidentate Glycosyl Heterocyclic Ligands in Various Cancer Cell Models.

AB  - Platinum complexes are used in chemotherapy , primarily as antineoplastic agents.In this study , we assessed the cytotoxic and cytostatic properties of a set ofosmium(II) , ruthenium(II) , iridium(III) and rhodium(III) half-sandwich-typecomplexes with bidentate monosaccharide ligands. We identified 5 compounds withmoderate to negligible acute cytotoxicity but with potent long-term cytostaticactivity. These structure-activity relationship studies revealed that: (1)osmium(II) p-cymene complexes were active in all models , while rhodium(III) andiridium(III) Cp* complexes proved largely inactive; (2) the biological effect wasinfluenced by the nature of the central azole ring of the ligands-1,2,3-triazolewas the most effective , followed by 1,3,4-oxadiazole , while the isomeric1,2,4-oxadiazole abolished the cytostatic activity; (3) we found a correlationbetween the hydrophobic character of the complexes and their cytostatic activity:compounds with O-benzoyl protective groups on the carbohydrate moiety wereactive , compared to O-deprotected ones. The best compound , an osmium(II) complex ,had an IC(50) value of 0.70 µM. Furthermore , the steepness of the inhibitorycurve of the active complexes suggested cooperative binding; cooperativemolecules were better inhibitors than non-cooperative ones. The cytostaticactivity of the active complexes was abolished by a lipid-soluble antioxidant ,vitamin E , suggesting that oxidative stress plays a major role in the biologicalactivity of the complexes. The complexes were active on ovarian cancer ,pancreatic adenocarcinoma , osteosarcoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma cells , but wereinactive on primary , non-transformed human fibroblasts , indicating theirapplicability as potential anticancer agents.

AB  - In the past decade , mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN)-induced gastrointestinal adverseeffects have been increasingly attracting worldwide attention. This study aimedto determine the gastrointestinal adverse effects of ZEN in Drosophilamelanogaster (D. melanogaster) and reveal possible mechanisms of action of ZEN ininsects. Here , chronic exposure of D. melanogaster to ZEN killed flies in adose-dependent manner (2-20 µM). ZEN (20 µM) decreased the survival rates andclimbing ability of flies , and activated immune deficiency-mediated intestinalimmunity in midgut , leading to the production of antimicrobial peptides.Meanwhile , ZEN exposure induced morphological alteration of adult midgut. Furtherstudy suggested that high levels of oxidative stress was observed in ZEN-treatedmidgut due to the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species andthe expression and activities of cellular antioxidant enzyme , includingsuperoxide dismutase and catalase. ZEN-induced oxidative stress then caused celldeath , impaired gut barrier function and increased gut permeability , leading tooxidative injury in midgut. Subsequently , ZEN-induce midgut injury furtherdisrupted intestinal stem cell (ISC) homeostasis , stimulating ISC proliferationand tissue regeneration , but did not alter cell fate specification of ISC.Additionally , activation of Jun N-terminal kinase pathway was involved inZEN-induced oxidative injury and tissue regeneration in midgut. Antioxidantvitamin E alleviated ZEN-induced oxidative injury to midgut epithelium.Collectively , this study provided additional evidences for ZEN-inducedgastrointestinal adverse effects from an invertebrate model , extended ourunderstanding of the mechanisms mediating mycotoxin toxicity in organisms.

TI  - Dermal exposure to nano-TiO(2) induced cardiovascular toxicity through oxidativestress , inflammation and apoptosis.
PG  - 35-45
LID - 10.2131/jts.44.35 [doi]
AB  - Due to its excellent properties such as ultraviolet obscuration , chemicalstability and small particle size , nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO(2)) is widelyused , particularly in sunblock products. The skin is therefore a chief route forexposure. Studies have found that oral or respiratory exposure to nano-TiO(2) hasan adverse impact on the cardiovascular system. The relationship between dermalexposure to nano-TiO(2) and cardiovascular system toxicity , particularly thecausative mechanisms , remain unclear. In this study , we used Balb/c mice toevaluate cardiovascular toxicity from nano-TiO(2) dermal exposure , and theunderlying mechanisms associated with the human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVECs) were explored. Our results showed that nano-TiO(2) treatment resulted inan obvious increase in reactive oxygen species and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ,indicating the appearance of oxidative stress. Moreover , the levels ofinflammatory biomarkers , such as immunoglobulin E , soluble intercellular adhesionmolecule-1 , interleukin-8 , and hypersensitive C-reactive protein , also increased.Exposing HUVECs to nano-TiO(2) led to a decline in cell vitality , and an increasein caspase-3 levels , suggesting that nano-TiO(2) exposure caused cytotoxicity andeven cell apoptosis. Interestingly , neutralizing oxidative stress byadministering Vitamin E was shown to reduce the inflammatory response andcytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that nano-TiO(2) can injure the cardiovascularsystem via dermal exposure , and does this via oxidative stress-inducedinflammation and cytotoxicity. Vitamin E treatment may be a strategy to mitigatethe damage.

Moreover , the totalantioxidant capacity can be amplified by synergistic interactions betweendifferent antioxidants. Here , we constructed a ternary heterojunction graphiticcarbon nitride/cupric sulfide/titanium dioxide (g-C(3)N(4)/CuS/TiO(2))photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for the quantification of SM and itssynergistic interactions with other antioxidants. Crucially , the Schottky barrierin ternary semiconductors considerably enhances electron transfer. The PEC sensorshowed a wide linear range for SM detection , ranging from 2 to 1277 μmol L(-1) ,and had a limit of detection of 1.8 μmol L(-1). Remarkably , this sensing platformcould evaluate the synergism between SM and five typical lipid-solubleantioxidants: tert-butyl hydroquinone , vitamin E , butyl hydroxyanisole , propylgallate , and butylated hydroxytoluene. Owing to its low redox potential , SM couldreduce antioxidant radicals and promote their regeneration , which increased theoverall antioxidant performance. The g-C(3)N(4)/CuS/TiO(2) PEC sensor exhibitedhigh sensitivity , satisfactory selectivity , and stability , and was successfullyapplied for SM determination in both soybean and peanut oils. The findings ofthis study provide guidance for the development of nutritional foods , nutritionanalysis , and the treatment of diseases caused by free radicals.

TI  - The Effects of Tocotrienol on Bone Peptides in a Rat Model of OsteoporosisInduced by Metabolic Syndrome: The Possible Communication between Bone Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16183313 [doi]
LID - 3313
AB  - A positive association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and osteoporosis hasbeen demonstrated in previous animal studies. The mechanisms of MetS inorchestrating the bone remodelling process have traditionally focused on theinteractions between mature osteoblasts and osteoclasts , while the role ofosteocytes is unexplored. Our earlier studies demonstrated the bone-promotingeffects of tocotrienol using a rat model of osteoporosis induced by MetS. Thisstudy aimed to investigate the expression of osteocyte-derived peptides in thebone of rats with MetS-induced osteoporosis treated with tocotrienol. Age-matchedmale Wistar rats (12-week-old; n = 42) were divided into seven experimentalgroups. Two groups served as the baseline and normal group , respectively. Theother five groups were fed with a high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diet toinduce MetS. The five groups of HCHF animals were treated withtocopherol-stripped corn oil (vehicle) , annatto tocotrienol (60 and 100 mg/kg) ,and palm tocotrienol (60 and 100 mg/kg) starting from week 8. At the end of thestudy , the rats were sacrificed and their right tibias were harvested. Proteinwas extracted from the metaphyseal region of the proximal right tibia and levelsof bone peptides , including osteoprotegerin (OPG) , soluble receptor activator ofnuclear factor-kappa B ligand (sRANKL) , sclerostin (SOST) , Dickkopf-relatedprotein 1 (DKK-1) , fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) , and parathyroid hormone(PTH) , were measured. The vehicle-treated animals displayed higher levels ofsRANKL , SOST , DKK-1 , FGF-23 , and PTH as compared to the normal animals. Oralsupplementation of annatto and palm tocotrienol (60 and 100 mg/kg) reduced thelevels of sRANKL and FGF-23 in the HCHF animals. Only 100 mg/kg annatto and palmtocotrienol lowered SOST and DKK-1 levels in the HCHF animals. In conclusion ,tocotrienol exerts potential skeletal-promoting benefit by modulating the levelsof osteocytes-derived bone-related peptides.

TI  - Physicochemical Evaluation of Personal Care Products Developed with Chondruscrispus Fractions Processed by Ecofriendly Methodologies.
LID - 10.3390/md20110695 [doi]
LID - 695
AB  - Novel personal care products are necessary to cope with the growing market demandfor sustainable green products. In this context , this work deals with theformulation and fundamental physicochemical and rheological characterization ofdifferent natural personal care products using bioactive fractions from Chondruscrispus red macroalgae extracted under optimized green conditions. Body milks ,body oils and shampoos were supplemented with soluble extracts with antioxidantfeatures recovered after hydrothermal (200 °C) and microwave (170 °C)- andultrasound (80 °C)-assisted extraction of the red macroalgae used as rawmaterial. Formulated products were also compared with those prepared using(±)-α-tocopherol and butylhydroxytoluene standards. Body scrubs were formulatedwith the remaining solids (<2.25%) after microwave hydrodiffusion and graviditytreatment of the macroalgae. Results indicated that selected extracts providedpersonal care products with similar or even better physicochemical , color andviscous features than those supplemented with (±)-α-tocopherol orbutylhydroxytoluene commercial antioxidants. Rheological profiles indicated thatit is possible to develop personal care products with adequate viscous behavior(102−105 mPa s , at 1 s−1) , comparable with their synthetic counterparts. Toconclude , the addition of antioxidant extracts led to lower apparent viscosityvalues suggesting an advantage from the skin applicability point of view , jointlywith the absence of both the hysteresis phenomenon and water syneresis of theproposed formulations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial fluorescence methods are of interest in endodontics forinforming endpoints for debridement. This study explored potential fluorescencequenching reversal effects of a water-soluble vitamin E conjugate (d-α-Tocopherolpolyethylene glycol 1000 succinate , TPGS) when applied to polymicrobial biofilmsgrown on dentine that had been exposed to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) to causequenching. METHOD: Extracted human teeth were debrided , embedded in transparentacrylic resin and sectioned. After smear layer removal , tooth dentine sectionswere inoculated with a polymicrobial inoculum , and cultured for 7 days to createbiofilms. Samples (n = 8 per group) were exposed to 1 % or 4 % NaOCl for 2 or 4min , and then treated with TPGS. Bacterial fluorescence readings under laserexcitation at 655 nm were assessed over 10 min using a calibrated DIAGNOdentdevice. All data were assessed for normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) andanalysed with ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests. RESULTS: NaOCl at bothconcentrations quenched fluorescence readings of biofilms grown on dentinesamples , with a maximal reduction of 40.4 % at 5 min after 4 % NaOCl. Treatmentwith TPGS gave faster recovery of fluorescence readings compared to the controlat 5 and 10 min. CONCLUSION: The water-soluble antioxidant TPGS partiallyreversed fluorescence quenching caused by NaOCl. This agent may have valueclinically for reducing the time needed for fluorescence readings to recover whenNaOCl is used as an irrigant. This will facilitate more accurate assessment ofendpoints for canal debridement.

TI  - Patterns of circulating fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids and risk of frailtyin four European cohorts of older adults.
PG  - 379-389
LID - 10.1007/s00394-017-1602-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the cross-sectional and prospective associations betweenpatterns of serum fat-soluble micronutrients and frailty in four European cohortsof older adults 65 years of age and older. METHODS: Participants from theThree-City (Bordeaux , France) , AMI (Gironde , France) , TSHA (Toledo , Spain) andInCHIANTI (Tuscany , Italy) cohorts with available data on serum α-carotene ,β-carotene , lycopene , cryptoxanthin , lutein + zeaxanthin , retinol , α-tocopherol ,γ-tocopherol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D) were included. A principalcomponent (PC) analysis was used to derive micronutrient patterns. Frailty wasdefined using Fried's criteria. Multivariate logistic regression models adjustedfor socio-demographic and health-related covariates were performed to assess theassociation between micronutrient patterns and prevalent frailty in 1324participants , and the risk of frailty in 915 initially non-frail participants.RESULTS: Three different patterns were identified: the first pattern wascharacterized by higher serum carotenoids and α-tocopherol levels; the second wascharacterized by high loadings for serum vitamins A and E levels and low loadingsfor carotenes level; the third one had the highest loading for serum 25(OH)D andcryptoxanthin level and the lowest loading for vitamin A and E. A significantcross-sectional association was only observed between the seconnd PC andprevalent frailty (p = 0.02). Compared to the highest quartile , participants inthe lowest quartile-i.e. , high carotenes and low vitamins E and A levels-hadhigher odds of frailty (Odds ratio = 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.8). Noassociation with the risk of frailty was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findingssuggest that some specific micronutrient patterns are markers but not predictorsof frailty in these European cohorts of older adults.

LID - 89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnolia bark extract (MBE) is a natural supplement with antioxidant ,anti-inflammatory , and antimicrobial activities. Its properties suggest that thedietary supplementation in livestock could improve the quality of products.Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate , for the first time , theeffect of dietary MBE supplementation (0.33 mg/kg) in finishing pigs on theoxidative stability of meat. Oxidative stability is of paramount importance forpork , as it affects storage , retail , and consumer acceptance. For the purpose ,the fatty acid profile , cholesterol , fat-soluble vitamins , antioxidant enzymes(catalase , glutathione peroxidase , and superoxide dismutase) , non-enzymaticantioxidant capacity (TEAC , FRAP , and Folin-Ciocalteu assays) , color stability ,and lipid stability of pork were assessed. RESULTS: Concerning carcasscharacteristics , dietary MBE did not affect cold carcass yield , but reduced(P = 0.040) the chilling weight loss. The meat from pigs fed MBE had a lower(P = 0.031) lightness index than the control meat. No effect on intramuscularfat , cholesterol , and fatty acid profile was observed. Dietary MBE did not affectthe content of vitamin E (α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol) in pork , whereas itreduced (P = 0.021) the retinol content. The catalase activity was 18% higher(P = 0.008) in the meat from pigs fed MBE compared with the control group. TheMBE supplementation reduced (P = 0.039) by 30% the thiobarbituric acid reactivesubstances (TBARS) in raw pork over 6 d of aerobic refrigerated storage. Instead ,no effect on lipid oxidation was observed in cooked pork. Last , the meat frompigs fed MBE reduced Fe(3+)-ascorbate catalyzed lipid oxidation in musclehomogenates , with a lower (P = 0.034) TBARS value than the control group after60 min of incubation. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary MBE supplementation in finishing pigsdelayed the lipid oxidation in raw meat. This effect was combined with anincreased catalase concentration. These results suggest that dietary MBE couldhave implications for improving the shelf-life of pork.

TI  - Effect of citrus waste on blood parameters of broiler birds with and withoutcocktail of enzymes.
PG  - 483-488
LID - 10.14202/vetworld.2019.483-488 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to assess the effect of different levels of citrus waste(CW) with or without enzyme cocktail on blood profile of broilers. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: CW was sun-dried and grounded to powder CW. 256-day-old birds weredistributed into eight groups; control (C) , CW-supplemented diets (2.5% CW , 5.0%CW , and 7.5% CW) , enzyme (E) cocktail supplemented diets (CE , 2.5% CWE , 5.0% CWE ,and 7.5% CWE). The diets were fed during starter (0-14 days) , grower (15-21days) , and finisher (22-42 days) phases. Blood was collected from the wing veinfrom four birds per treatment. Serum was separated out after centrifugation andstored at -20°C until further analysis. The samples were analyzed for liverfunction test (glucose , total protein [TP] , albumin [ALB] , and globulin) , lipidprofile (cholesterol and triglyceride) , kidney function test (alanineaminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase [AST] , blood urea nitrogen [BUN] ,and creatinine) , and antioxidant levels (catalase , superoxide dismutase [SOD] ,lipid peroxidation [LPx] , glutathione peroxidase [GPx] , glutathione [GSH] , andVitamins E and C). RESULTS: Blood profile data revealed that supplementation ofCW showed no effect on TP , ALB , globulin , and BUN levels. Plasma cholesterol ,triglyceride , and AST levels decreased linearly with an increase in the levels ofCW in the diet. Catalase and SOD activity increased non-significantly with anincrease in inclusion level of CW in the diets. LPx , GPx , and GSH activitiesdecreased (p≤0.05) up to 5% CW-fed groups. Vitamin E and C activity were found tobe highest (p≤0.05) in birds fed with diet supplemented with 5% CW. GPx and GSHactivities and serum Vitamin C levels were observed to be highest (p<0.05) inbirds fed CW (at 5%)-based diet supplemented with enzymes. CONCLUSION: The bloodprofile showed that supplementation of CW up to 5% decreased cholesterol ,triglyceride , and AST levels and improved the antioxidant status. Vitamin Clevels were observed to be highest (p<0.05) in birds fed CW (at 5%)-based dietsupplemented with enzymes.

AB  - Vitamin E comprises 8 fat-soluble isoforms: α- , β- , γ- , and δ-tocopherol and α- ,β- , γ- , and δ-tocotrienol. Yet the body preferentially uses α-tocopherol , andonly α-tocopherol supplementation can reverse vitamin E deficiency symptoms.However , other isoforms influence many biological functions in the body ,including inflammation and stress. Therefore , the study objective was todetermine metabolic and performance responses in young calves fed dietscontaining a constant amount of α-tocopherol and increasing amounts of soybeanoil-derived mixed γ- and δ-tocopherols. Holstein calves [n = 48; 2-3 d of age;40.2 kg of initial body weight (BW) , standard error = 0.54] were assigned toreceive approximately 0 , 5 , 10 , or 15 mg/kg of BW daily (treatments T0 , T1 , T2 ,and T3 , respectively) of mixed tocopherols (TMIX) provided in milk replacer (MR)and calf starter. The TMIX liquid contained 86% γδ-tocopherols and 9%α-tocopherol. Milk replacers were formulated to contain approximately 0 , 400 ,800 , or 1,200 mg of TMIX/kg for treatments T0 , T1 , T2 , and T3 , respectively. Calfstarters were formulated to contain approximately 0 , 250 , 500 , or 750 mg ofTMIX/kg for treatments T0 , T1 , T2 , and T3 , respectively. Mean consumption ofγδ-tocopherols was 0.0 , 6.5 , 14.3 , and 20.5 mg/kg of BW , respectively. Milkreplacer contained 24% crude protein (CP) and 20% fat on a dry matter (DM) basis.Calf starters were pelleted and offered for ad libitum consumption from 0 to 56d. Starters contained 18 to 20% CP and 9 to 12% starch in the DM. On d 28 , 4calves per treatment were randomly selected for slaughter , and necropsy wasperformed. Samples of liver , duodenum , ileum , and trapezius muscle were collectedand stored before analysis for α- , β- , γ- , and δ-tocopherols and δ-tocotrienol.Data were analyzed using a completely randomized design using mixed model ANOVAwith orthogonal polynomials to determine linear and quadratic effects of TMIX.Repeated-measures analyses were performed for data collected over time.Increasing dietary TMIX increased or tended to increase change in hip width at 28and 56 d , respectively , and improved average daily BW gain and gain-to-feed ratioat 56 d. Increasing TMIX reduced plasma xanthine oxidase at 0 h and tended toreduce concentrations at 24 h following vaccination with 2 commercial vaccines ond 28; however , we detected no effect of TMIX following vaccination on d 56.Concentration of α-tocopherol in skeletal muscle declined quadratically withincreasing TMIX , whereas ileal and liver γ-tocopherol increased linearly withincreasing TMIX. The number of mucin-2 cells in the ileum increased more than2-fold in calves fed T3. Addition of mixed tocopherols to diets of young dairycalves improved animal growth and altered indices of antioxidant metabolism.

TI  - Optimization the formulation parameters in preparation of α-tocopherolnanodispersions using low-energy solvent displacement technique.
PG  - 5-16
LID - 10.1024/0300-9831/a000441 [doi]
AB  - α-Tocopherol is the main compound of vitamin E with great antioxidant activity.However , like other functional lipid bioactive compounds , it suffers from lowbioavailability due to its low water solubility and liable chemical structure. Abottom-up procedure based on a solvent-displacement method was constructed forfabrication of α-tocopherol nanodispersions using response surface methodology(RSM). The effects of main formulation parameters , namely , weight ratio ofemulsifier to α-tocopherol and volumetric percent of acetone to water on theaverage particle size (nm) , polydispersity index , concentration of α-tocopherolloss (% w/w) and turbidity of the nanodispersions were evaluated and optimized togain the most desirable nanodispersions (least particle size , polydispersityindex , turbidity and highest α-tocopherol concentrations). Second orderregression equations , holding quite high coefficients of determination (R(2) andadjusted R(2) > 0.882) , were significantly (p-value < 0.05) fitted for predictingthe α-tocopherol nanodispersion characteristics variations as functions ofstudied formulation parameters. A multiple optimization analysis offered 6.5 and10% for weight ratio of Tween 20 to α-tocopherol and volume percent of acetone ,respectively , as overall optimum values for studied parameters. Statisticallyinsignificant differences between experimental and predicted values of studiedresponses , verified the satisfactoriness of presented models for explaining theresponse characteristics as a function of formulation parameters. Thus , theemployed solvent-displacement technique may provide the most desired waterdispersible α-tocopherol nanoparticles for several water-based foods , cosmeticnutraceutical formulations.

AB  - Many waterbirds have fully (totipalmate) or partially webbed (palmate) feet thatare used for locomotion in aquatic environments.If webbed feet and wings bothcontribute to efficient diving , we predicted a positive association between thearea of webbed feet and the size of the frontal locomotor apparatus (wing area ,heart mass , and breast muscle , after adjusting for any partial effects of bodysize). We predicted that individuals able to acquire more and better quality fooddue to larger webbed feet should have larger livers with higher concentrations offat-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E , and invest more in immune function asreflected by the relative size of the uropygial gland than individuals with smallwebbed feet.Here , we examine if the area of webbed feet is correlated withlocomotion , diet , and body condition in a sea-duck , the eider (Somateriamollissima). We analyzed an extensive database of 233 eiders shot in Danishwaters and at Åland , Finland during winter and early spring.Eiders with largerwebbed feet had a larger locomotor apparatus , but did not have larger body size ,they had larger uropygial glands that waterproof the plumage , they had largerbeak volume and larger gizzards , and they had higher body condition.Thesefindings imply that eiders with large webbed feet benefitted in terms oflocomotion , feeding , and reproduction.

LID - 476
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of ocular delivery of lipophilic drugs. The aimof the paper is the evaluation of polymeric micelles , prepared using TPGS(d-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) , a water-soluble derivativeof Vitamin E and/or poloxamer 407 , as a vehicle for the ocular delivery ofdexamethasone , cyclosporine , and econazole nitrate. The research steps were: (1)characterize polymeric micelles by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and X-rayscattering; (2) evaluate the solubility increase of the three drugs; (3) measurethe in vitro transport and conjunctiva retention , in comparison to conventionalvehicles; (4) investigate the mechanisms of enhancement , by studying drug releasefrom the micelles and transconjunctival permeation of TPGS; and (5) study theeffect of micelles application on the histology of conjunctiva. The data obtaineddemonstrate the application potential of polymeric micelles in ocular delivery ,due to their ability to increase the solubility of lipophilic drugs and enhancetransport in and across the conjunctival epithelium. The best-performingformulation was the one made of TPGS alone (micelles size ≈ 12 nm) , probablybecause of the higher mobility of these micelles , an enhanced interaction withthe conjunctival epithelium , and , possibly , the penetration of intact micelles.

LID - 10.2147/IJN.S237335 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In spite of its enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects in clinicalhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy , the therapeutic efficacy of antitumorangiogenesis inhibitor sorafenib (SFB) is still restricted due to short in vivohalf-life and drug resistance. Here , a novel SFB-loaded dendritic polymericnanoparticle (NP-TPGS-SFB) was developed for enhanced therapy of HCC. METHODS:NP-TPGS-SFB was fabricated by encapsulating SFB with biodegradable dendriticpolymers poly(amidoamine)-poly(γ-benzyl-L-Glutamate)-b-D-α-tocopherylpolyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (PAM-PBLG-b-TPGS). RESULTS: NP-TPGS-SFBexhibited excellent stability and achieved acid-responsive release of SFB. Italso exhibited much higher cellular uptake efficiency in HepG2 human liver cellsthan PEG-conjugated NP (NP-PEG-SFB). Furthermore , MTT assay confirmed thatNP-TPGS-SFB induced higher cytotoxicity than NP-PEG-SFB and free SFB ,respectively. Lastly , NP-TPGS-SFB significantly inhibited tumor growth in micebearing HepG2 xenografts , with negligible side effects. CONCLUSION: Our resultsuggests that NP-TPGS-SFB may be a novel approach for enhanced therapy of HCCwith promising potential.

AB  - The SEN virus (SENV) has been linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis;however , information regarding SENV infections in patients with thalassemia ,particularly in those with hepatitis virus co-infections , remains limited. Thisstudy investigated the frequency of SENV (genotypes D and H) infections in Iraqipatients with thalassemic patients infected and not infected with hepatitis Cvirus. The study involved 150 β-thalassemia patients (75 with HCV infections and75 without) and 75 healthy blood donors. Patient levels of vitamins C and E ,liver function markers , and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined.Recovered viral nucleic acids were amplified using the conventional polymerasechain reaction (SENV DNA) or the real-time polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA)techniques. Only 10% of healthy donors had evidence of SENV infection. Amongpatients with thalassemia , 80% and 77% of patients with and without concurrentHCV infections , respectively , had SENV infections. DNA sequencing analyses wereperformed on blood samples obtained from 29 patients. Patients with thalassemia ,particularly those with SENV infections , had higher levels of several enzymaticliver function markers and total serum bilirubin (P < 0.05) than did healthyblood donors. Among the examined liver function markers , only gamma-glutamyltransferase demonstrated significantly higher levels in HCV-negative patientsinfected with SENV-H than in those infected with SENV-D (P = 0.01). There weresignificantly lower vitamin C , vitamin E , and glutathione peroxidase levels inpatients than in healthy donors (P < 0.05) , but only glutathione peroxidaselevels were significantly lower in HCV-negative thalassemia patients infectedwith SENV than in those without SENV infections (P = 0.04). The SENV-H genotypesequences were similar to the global standard genes in GenBank. These resultsbroaden our understanding the nature of the SENV-H genotype and the differentialrole of SENV-H infections , compared to SENV-D infections , in patients withthalassemia , in Iraq.

TI  - Overcoming the challenges of developing an intranasal diazepam rescue therapy forthe treatment of seizure clusters.
PG  - 846-856
LID - 10.1111/epi.16847 [doi]
AB  - Seizure clusters must be treated quickly and effectively to prevent progressionto prolonged seizures and status epilepticus. Rescue therapy for seizure clustershas focused on the use of benzodiazepines. Although intravenous benzodiazepineadministration is the primary route in hospitals and emergency departments ,seizure clusters typically occur in out-of-hospital settings , where a moreportable product that can be easily administered by nonmedical caregivers isneeded. Thus , other methods of administration have been examined , includingrectal , intranasal , intramuscular , and buccal routes. Following US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) approval in 1997 , rectal diazepam became the mainstay ofout-of-hospital treatment for seizure clusters in the United States. However ,social acceptability and consistent bioavailability present limitations.Intranasal formulations have potential advantages for rescue therapies , includingease of administration and faster onset of action. A midazolam nasal spray wasapproved by the FDA in 2019 for patients aged 12 years or older. In early 2020 ,the FDA approved a diazepam nasal spray for patients aged 6 years or older , whichhas a different formulation than the midazolam nasal product and enhances aspectsof bioavailability. Benzodiazepines , including diazepam , present significantchallenges in developing a suitable intranasal formulation. Diazepam nasal spraycontains dodecyl maltoside (DDM) as an absorption enhancer and vitamin E toincrease solubility in an easy-to-use portable device. In a Phase 1 study ,absolute bioavailability of the diazepam nasal spray was 97% compared withintravenous diazepam. Subsequently , the nasal spray demonstrated less variabilityin bioavailability than rectal gel (percentage of geometric coefficient ofvariation of area under the curve = 42%-66% for diazepam nasal spray comparedwith 87%-172% for rectal gel). The diazepam nasal spray safety profile isconsistent with that expected for rectal diazepam , with low rates of nasaldiscomfort (≤6%). To further improve the efficacy of rescue therapy ,investigation of novel intranasal benzodiazepine formulations is underway.

AB  - Along with the increasing demand for candidate-enabling formulations comes theneed for appropriate in vitro bioavailability forecasting. Dissolution/permeation(D/P) systems employing cell-free permeation barriers are increasingly gaininginterest , due to their low cost and easy application as passive diffusionbio-predictive profiling in drug product development , as this accounts for nearly75% of new chemical entities (NCEs) absorption mechanism. To this end , this studycomprises theoretical considerations on the design and experimental work towardsthe establishment and optimization of a PermeaLoop™ based dissolution/permeationassay to simultaneously evaluate the drug release and permeation usingItraconazole (ITZ)-based amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) formulations , withdifferent drug loads , based on a solvent-shift approach. Alternative methodconditions were tested such as: donor medium , acceptor medium and permeationbarrier were screened using both PermeaPad® and PermeaPlain® 96-well plates. Arange of solubilizers , namely Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate , Vitamin E-TPGS andhydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin , were screened as possible solubilizing additives tothe acceptor medium , while donor medium was varied between blank FaSSIF(phosphate buffer) and FaSSIF. The method optimization also included the ITZ doseselection , being the ITZ single dose (100 mg) considered the most adequate to beused in further experiments to allow the comparison with in vivo studies. In theend , a standardized approach that may be applied to predict the bioavailabilityof weakly basic poorly soluble drug-based formulations is described , contributingto strengthening the analytical portfolio of in vitro pre-clinical drug productdevelopment.

AB  - Stingless bees are insects which are popularly bred by agriculturists in theeastern region of Thailand for the pollination of their orchards. The productsfrom stingless bee breeding include bee honey and bee propolis. The objective ofthis experiment is to study the possibility of developing stingless bee propoliswax into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) by the comparison of five surfactants(Brij 721 , Cremophor WO 7 , Myrj 52 , Poloxamer 188 , and Tween 80). Each surfactantis used at three concentrations: 10% , 20% , and 30%. A master formula is selectedaccording to the following: physical features , particle size , zeta potential , andentrapment. The results showed that Brij 721 and Myri 52 at 20% can be used inpreparing SLN and have good preservation properties for vitamin E (size: 451.2 nmand 416.8 nm , zeta potential: - 24.0 and - 32.7; % EE: 92.32% and 92.00% , resp.).Therefore , they are further developed by adding the following drugs at lowsolubility: curcumin , ibuprofen , and astaxanthin. It is found that a formulausing the surfactants Brij 721 and Myrj 52 at 20% have similar drug entrapment.The entrapment study involves curcumin 82% , ibuprofen 40% , and astaxanthin 67%.Moreover , the cytotoxicity test of blank solid lipid nanoparticle found notoxicty in fibroblast cell line (CRL-2522). Therefore , from this study , it isdetermined that stingless bee propolis wax has the potential to be developed toprovide more efficient SLN in the future.

AB  - In this study , the effects on the structures and emulsion gels of carrageenan(CA) and gum arabic (GA) with soybean protein isolate (SPI) were investigated.The results showed that CA and GA exposed hydrophobic groups to SPI , and formedcomplexes through non-covalent interactions to improve the stability of thecomplexes. Furthermore , the emulsion gels based on the emulsions exhibited thatCA formed emulsion-filled gels with higher elasticity , stronger gel strength , andthermal reversibility , whereas GA formed emulsion-aggregated gels with higherviscosity , and a weak-gel network. The results of digestion showed that , CA wasmore helpful to slow down the release of free fatty acids and protect vitamin Eduring digestion. Compared with SPI-GA emulsion gel , SPI-CA emulsion gel hadbetter physicochemical properties and stronger network structure. The results ofthis study may be useful in the development of anionic polysaccharides thatinteract with SPI , and they may provide new insights on the preparation ofemulsion gels that slowly release fat-soluble nutrients.

AB  - Tocopherols , lipid-soluble antioxidants play a crucial role in the antioxidantdefense system in higher plants. The antioxidant function of α-tocopherol hasbeen widely studied; however , experimental data on the formation of its oxidationproducts is missing. In this study , we attempt to provide spectroscopic evidenceon the detection of oxidation products of α-tocopherol formed by its interactionwith singlet oxygen and lipid peroxyl radical. Singlet oxygen was formed usingphotosensitizer rose bengal and thylakoid membranes isolated from Arabidopsisthaliana. Singlet oxygen reacts with polyunsaturated fatty acid forming lipidhydroperoxide which is oxidized by ferric iron to lipid peroxyl radical. Theaddition of singlet oxygen to double bond carbon on the chromanol head ofα-tocopherol forms α-tocopherol hydroperoxide detected using fluorescent probeswallow-tailed perylene derivative. The decomposition of α-tocopherolhydroperoxide forms α-tocopherol quinone. The hydrogen abstraction fromα-tocopherol by lipid peroxyl radical forms α-tocopheroxyl radical detected byelectron paramagnetic resonance. Quantification of lipid and proteinhydroperoxide from the wild type and tocopherol deficient (vte1) mutantArabidopsis leaves using a colorimetric ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange assayreveals that α-tocopherol prevents formation of both lipid and proteinhydroperoxides at high light. Identification of oxidation products ofα-tocopherol might contribute to a better understanding of the protective role ofα-tocopherol in the prevention of oxidative damage in higher plants at highlight.

AB  - Rice bran oil (RBO) comprises various nutrients and phytochemicals which exhibitseveral health benefits. There are no studies regarding the functional effects ofdifferent colours of RBO. This study was aimed to compare the constituents andantioxidant activities of white rice bran oil (WRBO) and coloured rice bran oil(CRBO). Each RBO showed similar free fatty acid profiles. However , greateramounts of vitamin E , phytosterols , carotenoids , and chlorophylls were found inCRBO , which had lower γ-oryzanol content than WRBO. Oxidative stress was inducedin male mice by an overdose of acetaminophen (APAP) at 300 mg/kg body weight. Themice were then fed with RBO at the equivalent dose to 100 mg/kg body weight ofγ-oryzanol three hours later and sacrificed six hours after APAP treatment. Theadministration of 100 mg γ-oryzanol equivalent in CRBO ameliorated APAP-inducedhepatotoxicity in mice more strongly than 100 mg γ-oryzanol equivalent in WRBO ,as evidenced by the significant reduction of serum ALT , hepatocellular necrosis ,and hepatic lipid peroxidation. CRBO could improve xenobiotic-metabolizing andantioxidant enzyme activities , including glutathione S-transferase , superoxidedismutase , glutathione peroxidase , and glutathione reductase , and also increasemRNA expression of various antioxidant-responsive genes. Vitamin E , phytosterols ,carotenoids , and chlorophyll might be the protective compounds in CRBO thatalleviate APAP-induced hepatotoxicity through the interruption of APAP metabolismand the activation of antioxidant systems at both transcriptional and enzymaticlevels. These findings might provide a protective role of CRBO on oxidativestress associated with several degenerative diseases.

AB  - A 4-year-old , female-spayed American Bulldog presented to the Ontario VeterinaryCollege's Health Sciences Center's Clinical Nutrition Service for nutritionalmanagement of hepatic enzymopathy and suspected copper-associated hepatitis.Medical history revealed a 3-month history of gradually increasing serum ALT.Additional diagnostics included negative Leptospira titters , normal bile acids ,and laparoscopic liver biopsy. Histopathology findings were consistent withdiffuse moderate vacuole hepatocellular degeneration , mild positive copperstaining , mild chronic lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis both portal and central , andmild biliary hyperplasia. Hepatic copper quantification results were above normalranges (630 μg/g dry tissue) , but below those seen in familial copper-associatedhepatitis (>800-1,000 μg/g dry tissue). The patient was prescribedursodeoxycholic acid , recommended to be fed a homemade diet (HMD) , and referredfor a nutrition consult. Two days before the nutrition consult , serum ALT fellwithin the normal range. The body condition score was 5/9 , with a good musclecondition score and the dog's appetite and body weight remained stable. Energyintake was appropriate for maintenance. Key nutrient levels of all diets reportedwere compared to industry standards (AAFCO , NRC , and FEDIAF). Diet historyincluded a commercially available raw meat-based diet (RMBD) , of unknown coppercontent; a high energy commercial dry food (HEC) , with copper content higher thanthe maximum recommended by FEDIAF and immediately prior to nutrition consult thepatient had been eating an unbalanced homemade diet (HMD1) for 4 weeks. HMD1 waslow in copper and deficient in the hepatoprotectant nutrients vitamin E and zinc.As per the owner's preference and to accommodate the patient's unique nutritionalneeds , a homemade diet addressing key nutrients for liver disease was formulated(HMD2) , with copper content just above the recommended minimum. The new diet wasfound palatable and the patient's body weight , body , and muscle condition scoresremained unchanged. Two months after starting HMD2 , all bloodwork values remainedwithin the normal range , including ALT. The reduction of dietary copper contentlikely reduced serum ALT. However , unbalanced diets cause a risk of nutrientdeficiencies and excess. This dog was maintained with no known adverse effects ona complete and balanced HMD diet with a moderately low copper content , moderateprotein , and inclusion of hepatoprotective nutrients.

TI  - Self-Assembly of pH-Labile Polymer Nanoparticles for Paclitaxel Prodrug Delivery:Formulation , Characterization , and Evaluation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21239292 [doi]
LID - 9292
AB  - The efficacy of paclitaxel (PTX) is limited due to its poor solubility , poorbioavailability , and acquired drug resistance mechanisms. Designing paclitaxelprodrugs can improve its anticancer activity and enable formulation ofnanoparticles. Overall , the aim of this work is to improve the potency ofpaclitaxel with prodrug synthesis , nanoparticle formation , and synergisticformulation with lapatinib. Specifically , we improve potency of paclitaxel byconjugating it to α-tocopherol (vitamin E) to produce a hydrophobic prodrug(Pro); this increase in potency is indicated by the 8-fold decrease in halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) concentration in ovarian cancer cellline , OVCA-432 , used as a model system. The efficacy of the paclitaxel prodrugwas further enhanced by encapsulation into pH-labile nanoparticles using FlashNanoPrecipitation (FNP) , a rapid , polymer directed self-assembly method. Therewas an 1100-fold decrease in IC(50) concentration upon formulating the prodruginto nanoparticles. Notably , the prodrug formulations were 5-fold more potentthan paclitaxel nanoparticles. Finally , the cytotoxic effects were furtherenhanced by co-encapsulating the prodrug with lapatinib (LAP). Formulating thedrug combination resulted in synergistic interactions as indicated by thecombination index (CI) of 0.51. Overall , these results demonstrate this prodrugcombined with nanoparticle formulation and combination therapy is a promisingapproach for enhancing paclitaxel potency.

TI  - Impact of Harvest Month and Drying Process on the Nutritional and BioactiveProperties of Wild Palmaria palmata from Atlantic Canada.
LID - 10.3390/md21070392 [doi]
LID - 392
AB  - The macroalga Palmaria palmata could be a sustainable and nutritional foodresource. However , its composition may vary according to its environment and toprocessing methods used. To investigate these variations , wild P. palmata fromQuebec were harvested in October 2019 and June 2020 , and dried (40 °C , ≃5 h) orstored as frozen controls (-80 °C). The chemical (lipids , proteins , ash ,carbohydrates , fibers) , mineral (I , K , Na , Ca , Mg , Fe) , potential bioactivecompound (carotenoids , polyphenols , β-carotene , α-tocopherol) compositions , andthe in vitro antioxidant activity and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)inhibition potential of water-soluble extracts were determined. The resultssuggested a more favorable macroalgae composition in June with a higher contentof most nutrients , minerals , and bioactive compounds. October specimens werericher only in carbohydrates and carotenoids. No significant differences inantioxidant or anti-ACE inhibitory activities were found between the two harvestmonths. The drying process did not significantly impact the chemical and mineralcompositions , resulting in only small variations. However , drying had negativeimpacts on polyphenols and anti-ACE activities in June , and on carotenoids inOctober. In addition , a concentration effect was observed for carotenoids ,β-carotene and α-tocopherol in June. To provide macroalgae of the highestnutritional quality , the drying process for June specimens should be selected.

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate how using betaine levels as a choline substituteaffects productive performance , egg quality parameters , fatty acids profile , andantioxidant status in laying hens. One hundred and forty brown chickens , 45 wkold , were divided into 4 groups , each group of 7 replicates with 5 chickens perreplicate. The first group of diets with choline has control (A) 100% choline ,the second group (B) 75% choline + 25% betaine , the third group (C) 50%choline + 50% betaine , and the fourth group (D) received 100% betaine. Nosignificant effects were observed in final body weight (BW) , body weight gain(BWG) , egg production (EW) , and feed intake (FI) for laying hens. In the diet inwhich betaine was replaced choline , egg mass (EM) and egg weight (EW) increasedcompared to the control group (P < 0.05). Also , after 12 wk of feeding , the eggquality parameters were not influenced; however , yolk color was increasedsignificantly compared with the control group. Serum total cholesterol ,LDL-lipoprotein , HDL-lipoprotein , triglyceride , glucose , aspartate transaminase(AST) , and alanine transaminase (ALT) were not affected by replacing choline withbetaine. Furthermore , liver malondialdehyde (MDA) content , yolk vitamin E , andfatty acid levels were not significantly affected by replacing choline withbetaine. Moreover , hens fed betaine displayed an increased antibody titer of theNewcastle disease (ND) virus. EW and EM were increased by 3.50% and 5.43% in 100%betaine group (D) when compared to the control group. Isthmus weight wasdecreased by 48.28 % in 50% choline + 50% betaine group (C) when compared to thecontrol group. ND was increased by 26.24% in 100% betaine group when compared tothe control group. In conclusion , betaine supplementation positively affectedproductive performance , egg quality measurements , and immunity response in Bovansbrown laying hens.

TI  - α-Tocotrienol Protects Neurons by Preventing Tau Hyperphosphorylation viaInhibiting Microtubule Affinity-Regulating Kinase Activation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25158428 [doi]
LID - 8428
AB  - In the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease , neuronal cell death isclosely related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Our previousstudies have found that oxidative stress can activate microtubuleaffinity-regulating kinases , resulting in elevated phosphorylation levels of tauprotein specifically at the Ser262 residue in N1E-115 cells that have beensubjected to exposure to hydrogen peroxide. This process may be one of thepathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble ,naturally occurring antioxidant that plays a crucial role in biological systems.This study aimed to examine the probable processes that contribute to theinhibiting effect on the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and theneuroprotective activity of a particular type of vitamin E , α-tocotrienol. Theexperimental analysis revealed that α-tocotrienol showed significantneuroprotective effects in the N1E-115 cell line. Our data further suggest thatone of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of α-tocotrienol maybe through the inhibition of microtubule affinity-regulated kinase activation ,which significantly reduces the oxidative stress-induced aberrant elevation ofp-Tau (Ser262) levels. These results indicate that α-tocotrienol may represent anintriguing strategy for treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease.

LID - 1866
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide ,influenced by the interaction of factors , including age , sex , genetic conditions ,overweight/obesity , hypertension , an abnormal lipid profile , vitamindeficiencies , diabetes , and psychological factors. This study aimed to assess therelationships between psychosocial and nutritional factors in a group of 61patients with CVD (i.e. , atherosclerosis , hypertension , ischemic heart disease ,and myocardial infarction) and their possible impact on the course of thedisease. The plasma concentrations of vitamins A , E , D , and β-carotene weredetermined using validated HPLC-MS/MS , while the lipid profile was analyzedenzymatically. Psychosocial factors and nutritional behaviors were assessed usingauthor-designed questionnaires. Over 50% of patients had 25-OH-D3 and retinoldeficiencies , while >85% of patients exhibited significant deficiencies inα-tocopherol and β-carotene. The lipid profile showed no specific relationshipwith any particular CVD. Dietary behavior minimally impacted biochemicalparameters except for higher β-carotene concentrations in the group with higherfruit and vegetable intake. The negative impact of the CVD on selected parametersof quality of life was noticed. To increase the effectiveness of the preventionand treatment of CVD , the need for interdisciplinary cooperation observed betweendoctors , psychologists , and specialists in human nutrition seems to be justified.

AB  - The anti-tumor efficacy of curcumin can be markedly improved by nano-drugself-delivery systems with high drug loading capacity and smartstimulus-triggered drug release in tumor cells. Herein , a type of novel ,glutathione (GSH)-responsive , PEGylated prodrug nano-micelles (PPNMs) wasprepared by self-assembly of curcumin-s-s-vitamin E/mPEG2k-DSPE mixture. ThePPNMs (entrapment efficiency: 96.7%) was acceptably stable in water with a meanparticle size of 29.84 nm. Compared with curcumin-loaded mPEG2k-DSPEnano-micelles (CUR-NMs) , PPNMs showed a higher drug loading (1.68% vs 27.3%) andremarkably improved the chemical stability of curcumin in phosphate buffer saline(PBS) (pH = 7.4) , 10% FBS culture medium , and rat plasma. In vitro release studyshowed that PPNMs could redox responsively control the release of curcumin fromthe prodrug. Moreover , PPNMs showed a cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells similar to thatof the free curcumin; however , when the HepG2 cells were pretreated with 1 mMGSH , PPNMs displayed a markedly enhanced cytotoxicity and cellular uptake thanthe free curcumin. After intravenous injection , PPNMs showed an increasedhalf-life in blood circulation (10.6-fold) and bioavailability (107-fold)compared with the free curcumin injection. Altogether , the prodrug nano-micellesrepresent a promising preparation for sustained and controlled delivery ofcurcumin with enhanced antitumor activity.

TI  - Antioxidants help favorably regulate the kinetics of lipid peroxidation ,polyunsaturated fatty acids degradation and acidic cannabinoids decarboxylationin hempseed oil.

AB  - The seed of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa L.) has been revered as a nutritionalresource in Old World Cultures. This has been confirmed by contemporary sciencewherein hempseed oil (HSO) was found to exhibit a desirable ratio of omega-6 andomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) considered optimal for humannutrition. HSO also contains gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) and non-psychoactivecannabinoids , which further contribute to its' potential bioactive properties.Herein , we present the kinetics of the thermal stability of these nutraceuticalcompounds in HSO , in the presence of various antioxidants (e.g. butylatedhydroxytoluene , alpha-tocopherol , and ascorbyl palmitate). We focussed onoxidative changes in fatty acid profile and acidic cannabinoid stability when HSOwas heated at different temperatures (25 °C to 85 °C) for upto 24 h. The fattyacid composition was evaluated using both GC/MS and (1)H-NMR , and thecannabinoids profile of HSO was obtained using both HPLC-UV and HPLC/MS methods.The predicted half-life (DT50) for omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs in HSO at 25 °C wasabout 3 and 5 days , respectively; while that at 85 °C was about 7 and 5 hoursrespectively , with respective activation energies (E(a)) being 54.78 ± 2.36 and45.02 ± 2.87 kJ/mol. Analysis of the conjugated diene hydroperoxides (CDH) andp-Anisidine value (p-AV) revealed that the addition of antioxidants significantly(p < 0.05) limited lipid peroxidation of HSO in samples incubated at 25-85 °C for24 h. Antioxidants reduced the degradation constant (k) of PUFAs in HSO by upto79%. This corresponded to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in color stabilityand pigment retention (chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b and carotenoids) of heatedHSO. Regarding the decarboxylation kinetics of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) in HSO ,at both 70 °C and 85 °C , CBDA decarboxylation led to predominantly cannabidiol(CBD) production. The half-life of CBDA decarboxylation (originally 4 days) couldbe increased to about 17 days using tocopherol as an antioxidant. We propose thatdetermining acidic cannabinoids decarboxylation kinetics is a useful marker tomeasure the shelf-life of HSO. The results from the study will be useful forresearchers looking into the thermal treatment of hempseed oil as a functionalfood product , and those interested in the decarboxylation kinetics of the acidiccannabinoids.

TI  - Novel Extract from Beetle Ulomoides dermestoides: A Study of Composition andAntioxidant Activity.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10071055 [doi]
LID - 1055
AB  - A biologically active extract from the darkling beetle Ulomoides dermestoides wasobtained using the electro-pulse plasma dynamic extraction method. The beetlewater extract contained a complex of antioxidant substances such as antioxidantenzymes and nonprotein antioxidants , as well as a complex of heat shockantistress proteins. This determines the rather high antioxidant activity of theaqueous extract of the beetle , i.e. , 1 mg of dry matter/mL of the extract has anequivalent antioxidant activity to 0.2 mM Trolox (a water-soluble analog ofvitamin E). It was shown that the beetle extract can lead to a 25-30% increase inthe average lifespan of nematode Caenorhabditiselegans , under normal conditions ,and a 12-17% increase under conditions of oxidative stress (with paraquat) , andsignificantly inhibits the fructosylation reaction of serum albumin. Therefore ,the beetle aqueous extract shows promise as a biologically active complexexhibiting antioxidant activity.

TI  - TPGS-1000 exhibits potent anticancer activity for hepatocellular carcinoma invitro and in vivo.
PG  - 1624-1642
LID - 10.18632/aging.102704 [doi]
AB  - D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS1000) is the mostactive water-soluble derivative of vitamin E and has been widely used as acarrier of solvents , plasticizers , emulsifiers , absorbent agents and refractorydrug delivery systems. However , its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)properties have not been explored. HCC cells were treated with differentconcentrations of TPGS1000. Cell survival was tested by CCK8 assay , and cellmigration was tested by wound healing and Transwell assay. EdU staining verifiedcell proliferation , and signalling pathway was assayed by Western blot analysis.The BALB/c-nu mouse xenograft model was established to test HCC cell growth invivo. In vitro TPGS1000 significantly inhibited the viability and mobility of HCCcells (HepG2 , Hep3B and Huh7) in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysisindicated that TPGS1000 treatment arrested the HCC cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase ,and induction of cell apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-7-AADstaining. Further pharmacological analysis indicated that collapse of thetransmembrane potential of mitochondria , increased ROS generation , PARP-inducedcell apoptosis and FoxM1-p21-mediated cell cycle arresting , were involved in theanti-HCC activity of TPGS1000. Moreover , treatment in vivo with TPGS1000effectively impaired the growth of HCC xenografts in nude mice.

AB  - Splice-modulating antisense therapy has shown tremendous potential in therapeuticdevelopment in recent years with four FDA-approved antisense drugs since 2016.However , an efficient and nontoxic antisense oligonucleotide (AO) delivery systemstill remains as a major obstacle in nucleic acid therapeutics field. Vitamin-E(α-tocopherol) is an essential dietary requirement for human body. Thisfat-soluble compound is one of the most important antioxidants which involves innumerous biological pathways. In this study , for the first time , we explored thescope of using α-tocopherol-conjugated bioresponsive AOs to induce splicemodulation in mouse muscle myotubes in vitro. Our results showed that thebioresponsive construct efficiently internalized into the cell nucleus andinduced exon 23 skipping in mdx mouse myotubes. Based on our exciting newresults , we firmly believe that our findings could potentially benefit towardestablishing a delivery approach to advance the field of splice-modulating AOtherapy.

AB  - Raloxifene is commonly used for breast cancer protection. The low bioavailabilityof raloxifene (2%) is the result of its low solubility and intestinalglucuronidation. The nano-lipid carriers are characterized by small particlesize , biocompatibility , and sustainable properties that improve cellular uptakeof the loaded drug. The aim of this study was the improvement of raloxifenebioavailability by enhancing its solubility and cellular penetration throughformulation of D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate basedtransferosomes and augmenting their effect with the cationic cell-penetratingpeptide transactivator of transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus.Particle size , zeta potential , and transmission electron microscope investigationof the formed nanocarriers were carried out. Ex vivo raloxifene permeationthrough rat skin and cell viability studies was investigated. The results ofD-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate- transactivator oftranscription of the human immunodeficiency virus transferosomes showed anaverage vesicle size of 96.05 nm with positively charged vesicles 39.4 mV of zetapotential value. The results revealed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement ofraloxifene permeation from raloxifene transferosomes- loaded film when comparedwith raw raloxifene film. IC50 results showed significant improvement offormulated raloxifene cytotoxicity by 1.42-fold in comparison with raw raloxifeneagainst MCF-7 cell lines. The developed raloxifene-transferosomes are consideredpromising nano-lipid carriers for the enhancement delivery of raloxifene.

AB  - Canine mammary tumors (CMT) can severely compromise the life quality of theaffected dogs through local recurrence , distant metastases and ultimately succumbto death. Recently , more attention has been given to the potential antimetastaticeffect of maduramicin (MAD) on breast cancer. However , its poor aqueoussolubility and toxicity to normal tissues limit its clinical application.Therefore , to address the drawbacks of MAD and enhance its anticancer andantimetastatic effects , MAD-loaded TPGS polymeric micelles (MAD-TPGS) wereprepared by a thin-film hydration technique. The optimized MAD-TPGS exhibitedexcellent size distribution , stability and improved water solubility. Cellularuptake assays showed that TPGS polymer micelles could enhance druginternalization. Moreover , TPGS synergistically improved the cytotoxicity of MADby targeting mitochondrial organelles , improving reactive oxygen species levelsand reducing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. More importantly ,MAD-TPGS significantly impeded the metastasis of tumor cells. In vivo resultsfurther confirmed that , in addition to exhibiting excellent biocompatibility ,MAD-TPGS exhibited greater antitumor efficacy than free MAD. Interestingly ,MAD-TPGS displayed superior suppression of CMT metastasis via tail vein injectioncompared to oral administration , indicating its suitability for intravenousdelivery. Overall , MAD-TPGS could be applied as a potential antimetastatic canceragent for CMT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in mammals proved dietary organic selenium (Se) beingsuperior to inorganic Se regarding effects on growth performance , antioxidativestatus , immune response , and Se homeostasis. However , the picture of possibleeffects of different Se sources and - levels can be expanded. The present fieldstudy evaluated the effects on weight gain , hematological and selectedbiochemical variables as well as plasma concentrations of vitamin E (vitE) , totalSe and selenobiomolecules in piglets throughout the suckling period. METHODS:Piglets were monitored from birth to 38 days of age (d). The mother sows' dietswere enriched with l-selenomethionine (SeMet-0.26 and -0.43 mg Se/kg feed) orsodium selenite (NaSe-0.40 and -0.60 mg Se/kg feed) from 1 month prior tofarrowing until the end of lactation period. Piglets received pelleted feedsupplemented with Se similarly to the sows' diets from one week of age. Seleniteat 0.40 mg Se/kg (NaSe-0.40) represents a common Se source and -level in pig feedand served as control diet. RESULTS: From 24d , piglets in SeMet-groups had highermean body weight (BW) compared with piglets from sows fed NaSe-0.40. Furthermore ,from five-d and above , piglets from sows fed NaSe-0.60 had significantly higherBW than offspring from sows fed NaSe-0.40. Neonatal piglets in group SeMet-0.43had significantly lower red blood cell counts (RBC) , hemoglobin (Hgb) andhematocrit (Hct) concentrations compared with piglets from sows fed withNaSe-0.40. Neonatal and 5d-old piglets in group SeMet-0.26 showed highergamma-glutamyl transferase activity than piglets in group NaSe-0.40. From five dand above , group NaSe-0.60 excelled with increased specific hematologicalvariables culminating at age 38d with increased Hct , mean corpuscular volume(MCV) , and MC hemoglobin (MCH) as well as increased activities of aspartatetransaminase and lactate dehydrogenase compared with the other groups. Generally ,offspring in the SeMet groups had higher total Se-concentrations in plasma thanthose from sows fed selenite , and showed a dose-response effect on plasmaSe-concentrations. Furthermore , SeMet-fed piglets had higher plasma levels of theselenoproteins (Sel) glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) and SelP as well asselenoalbumin. Plasma vitE levels were significantly negatively correlated withRBC throughout trial period. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal supplementation with SeMetduring gestation influenced hematology and clinical biochemistry in neonatalpiglets in a different way than in offspring from sows receiving seleniteenriched diets. Growth performance was positively influenced by both dietary Sesource and Se level. Higher plasma levels of GPx3 observed in piglets receivingSeMet probably improved the protection against birth or growth related oxidativestress. These might prime the piglets for demanding situations as indicated byhigher weight gain in offspring from sows fed with SeMet-supplemented diets. Ourresults on some enzyme activities might indicate that piglets fed NaSe-0.60 hadto cope with increased levels of oxidative stress compared with those originatingfrom sows fed SeMet or lower dietary levels of selenite. We assume that combininginorganic and organic Se sources in complete feed for breeding sows might bebeneficial fro reproduction and the offspring's performance.

TI  - Preserving the Integrity of Surfactant-Stabilized Microbubble Membranes forLocalized Oxygen Delivery.

AB  - Ultrasound contrast agents consist of stabilized microbubbles. We are developinga surfactant-stabilized microbubble platform with a shell composed of Span 60(Sorbitan monostearate) and an emulsifying agent , water-soluble vitamin E(α-tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol) succinate , abbreviated as TPGS) , named SE61.The microbubbles act both as an imaging agent and a vehicle for delivering oxygento hypoxic areas in tumors. For clinical use , it is important that a platform bestable under storage at room temperature. To accomplish this , a majority ofbiologicals are prepared as freeze-dried powders , which also eliminates thenecessity of a cold chain. The interfaces among the surfactants , gas , and liquidsare subject to disruption in both the freezing and drying phases. Usingthermocouples to monitor temperature profiles , differential scanning calorimetryto determine the phase transitions , and acoustic properties to gauge the degreeof microbubble disruption , the effects of the freezing rate and the addition ofdifferent concentrations of lyoprotectants were determined. Slower cooling ratesachieved by freezing the samples in a -20 °C bath were found to be reproducibleand produce contrast agents with acceptable acoustical properties. The ionicstrength of the solutions and the concentration of the lyoprotectant determinedthe glass-transition temperature (T(g)') of the frozen sample , which determinesat what temperature samples can be dried without collapse. Crucially , we foundthat the shelf stability of surfactant-shelled oxygen microbubbles can beenhanced by increasing the lyoprotectant (glucose) concentration from 1.8 to 5.0%(w/v) , which prevents the melt temperature (T(m)) of the TPGS phase from risingabove room temperature. The increase in glucose concentration results in alowering of T(m) of the emulsifying agent , preventing a phase change in theliquid-crystalline phase and allowing for more stable bubbles. We believe thatpreventing this phase change is necessary to producing stabilized freeze-driedmicrobubbles.

AB  - PURPOSE: This current research study was designed to investigate beneficialeffects of R. humilis (Rivina humilis) against streptozotocin-induced diabeticrats. METHODS: The R. humilis ethanol extract was prepared using soxhlet and itsphenol content was determined. The type-2 diabetes was induced in rats by givingfructose mixed drinking water and single dose of streptozotocin. Oral glucosetolerance test (OGTT) was performed after 72 h of streptozotocin to check abilityof extract to utilize oral glucose load with 2 h. The extract was also tested forits potentials to reduce blood glucose (BGL) and diabetic complications byadministering to diabetic rats for 21 days. Blood glucose was determined on day1 , 7 , 14 and 21. At 21st day , blood samples were collected from experimental ratswere euthanized to collect pancreas and liver. Liver and kidney function tests ,HbAc1 and lipid profile was established from blood samples. Pancreas wassubjected to histopathological examination and liver was used to determineantioxidant enzymes. In vitro study was done to investigate the effect of extracton glucose utilization by rat hemidiaphragm. RESULTS: In OGTT , administration ofextract could stimulate glucose utilization which was witnessed by significantBGL reduction at 90 and 120 min in therapeutic groups compare to diabetics. Inchronic study , we observed significant reduction in BGL on 21st day and all testsperformed to determine liver and kidney function , HbAc1 , vitamin E were normal inextract treated groups. There was significant increase in liver antioxidantenzymes in therapeutic groups which revealed regeneration of β-cells intherapeutic groups. CONCLUSION: The results of research demonstrated significantantidiabetic potentials in R. humilis.

TI  - Antioxidative effects of supplementing linseed oil-enriched diets withα-tocopherol , ascorbic acid , selenium , or their combination on carcass and meatquality in broilers.
PG  - 6733-6741
LID - 10.3382/ps/pez389 [doi]
AB  - In a previous study , we examined the synergistic effects of the dietarysupranutritional supplementation with vitamin E , vitamin C , and Se on the in vivoantioxidative status of broilers under conditions of dietary oxidative stressinduced by feeding a diet high in n-3 PUFA. In this study , we examined the effectof their inclusion on the quality characteristics and oxidative stability of rawor cooked meat , both fresh or after a long-term frozen storage. Four hundred21-day-old Ross 308 male broilers were allocated to 5 experimental groups fed 5%linseed oil-enriched finisher diets (days 21 to 40): Cont (recommended levels ofvitamin E , C , and selenium) , +E (200 IU vitamin E/kg feed) , +C (250 mg vitaminC/kg feed) , +Se (0.2 mg selenium/kg feed) , or +ECSe (concentrations as in thesole supplementation , combined). Animal performance and carcass characteristicswere monitored at the age of 40 D. Breast meat samples of 12 chickens per groupwere analysed fresh , fresh after frozen storage , cooked fresh , and cooked afterfrozen storage (2 × 2 factorial design) for parameters of meat quality(water-holding capacity-WHC , pH , and color) and oxidative stability(concentrations of vitamin E , malondialdehyde-MDA , antioxidant capacity of thewater-soluble compounds-ACW , and fatty acid composition). Vitamin E alone (+E)and combined with Se and vitamin C (+ECSe) increased the α-tocopherolconcentration in breast muscle , and showed similar protective effects againstlipid peroxidation measured as MDA regardless of the frozen storage or cooking.The sole supplementation of vitamin C or selenium showed no effects on the meatquality parameters. In conclusion , the dietary supranutritional inclusion ofvitamin E inhibited the lipid peroxidation in fresh , frozen stored , cooked fresh ,and frozen stored meat in broilers fed with diets rich in n-3 PUFAs. Even thoughno clear synergistic effects of the supranutritional supplementation of vitamin Cand Se with vitamin E were detected , their dietary inclusion did not negativelyaffect broilers carcass and meat quality parameters.

TI  - Synthesis of Daidzein Glycosides , α-Tocopherol Glycosides , Hesperetin Glycosidesby Bioconversion and Their Potential for Anti-Allergic Functional-Foods andCosmetics.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24162975 [doi]
LID - 2975
AB  - Daidzein is a common isoflavone , having multiple biological effects such asanti-inflammation , anti-allergy , and anti-aging. α-Tocopherol is the tocopherolisoform with the highest vitamin E activity including anti-allergic activity andanti-cancer activity. Hesperetin is a flavone , which shows potentanti-inflammatory effects. These compounds have shortcomings , i.e. ,water-insolubility and poor absorption after oral administration. Theglycosylation of bioactive compounds can enhance their water-solubility ,physicochemical stability , intestinal absorption , and biological half-life , andimprove their bio- and pharmacological properties. They were transformed bycultured Nicotiana tabacum cells to 7-β-glucoside and 7-β-gentiobioside ofdaidzein , and 3'- and 7-β-glucosides , 3',7-β-diglucoside , and 7-β-gentiobiosideof hesperetin. Daidzein and α-tocopherol were glycosylated by galactosylationwith β-glucosidase to give 4'- and 7-β-galactosides of daidzein , which were newcompounds , and α-tocopherol 6-β-galactoside. These nine glycosides showed higheranti-allergic activity , i.e. , inhibitory activity toward histamine release fromrat peritoneal mast cells , than their respective aglycones. In addition , theseglycosides showed higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity than the correspondingaglycones. Glycosylation of daidzein , α-tocopherol , and hesperetin greatlyimproved their biological activities.

TI  - Apomorphine Suppresses the Progression of Steatohepatitis by InhibitingFerroptosis.
LID - 10.3390/antiox13070805 [doi]
LID - 805
AB  - The role of ferroptosis in steatohepatitis development is largely unknown. Weinvestigated (1) whether hepatocyte ferroptosis occurs in a gene-modifiedsteatohepatitis model without modifying dietary components , (2) whetherferroptosis occurs at an early stage of steatohepatitis , and (3) whetherapomorphine , recently reported as a ferroptosis inhibitor , can amelioratesteatohepatitis. Hepatocyte-specific PTEN KO mice were used. Huh 7 and primarycultured hepatocytes isolated from the mice were used in this study. The numberof dead cells increased in 10-week-old PTEN KO mice. This cell death wassuppressed by the administration of ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 for 2weeks. Apomorphine also ameliorated the severity of steatohepatitis. Treatmentwith ferroptosis inhibitors , including apomorphine , decreases the level of lipidperoxidase. Apomorphine suppressed cell death induced by RSL-3 (a ferroptosisinducer) , which was not suppressed by apoptosis or necroptosis inhibitors.Apomorphine showed a radical trapping capacity with much more potent activitythan ferrostatin-1 and Trolox , a soluble form of vitamin E. In addition ,apomorphine activated nrf2 and its downstream genes , including HO-1 and xCT. Inconclusion , ferroptosis occurs in steatohepatitis from an early stage in PTEN KOmice. In addition , apomorphine ameliorates the severity of steatohepatitis byinhibiting ferroptosis.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to improve the aqueous solubility ,dissolution , and antioxidant activity of the water-insoluble drug piperine (PIP).The study was performed by preparing PIP binary inclusion complex (PIP BIC) andpiperine ternary inclusion complex (PIP TIC) by different methods. The effect ofa hydrophilic auxiliary substance (TPGS) was assessed with addition to PIP andhydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin (HP β CD) complex. The phase solubility study wasperformed to evaluate the complexation efficiency and stability constant. Theaqueous solubility , dissolution , physicochemical assessment , antioxidantactivity , antimicrobial activity , and molecular docking were further evaluated tocheck the effect of the complexation of PIP. The stability constant (Ks) valuewas found to be 238 and 461 M(-1) for the binary and ternary inclusion complex.The dissolution study results showed a marked enhancement of release incomparison to pure drug. XRD and SEM studies revealed the presence of moreagglomerated and amorphous structures of PIP , which confirmed the formation ofcomplexes. The results of DPPH radical scavenging and antimicrobial activityshowed a significant (p < 0.05) enhancement in scavenging activity for PIP TIC(microwave irradiation (MI)). The docking studies have revealed that the bindingaffinity of TPGS at the PIP-HP β CD complex was -5.2 kcal/mol.

AB  - The recretohalophyte Karelinia caspia is of forage and medical value and canremediate saline soils. We here assess the contribution of primary/secondarymetabolism to osmotic adjustment and ROS homeostasis in Karelinia caspia undersalt stress using multi-omic approaches. Computerized phenomic assessments , testsfor cellular osmotic changes and lipid peroxidation indicated that salt treatmenthad no detectable physical effect on K. caspia. Metabolomic analysis indicatedthat amino acids , saccharides , organic acids , polyamine , phenolic acids , andvitamins accumulated significantly with salt treatment. Transcriptomic assessmentidentified differentially expressed genes closely linked to the changes in aboveprimary/secondary metabolites under salt stress. In particular , shifts incarbohydrate metabolism (TCA cycle , starch and sucrose metabolism , glycolysis) aswell as arginine and proline metabolism were observed to maintain a low osmoticpotential. Chlorogenic acid/vitamin E biosynthesis was also enhanced , which wouldaid in ROS scavenging in the response of K. caspia to salt. Overall , our findingsdefine key changes in primary/secondary metabolism that are coordinated tomodulate the osmotic balance and ROS homeostasis to contribute to the salttolerance of K. caspia.

TI  - Quinoa Soluble Fiber and Quercetin Alter the Composition of the Gut Microbiomeand Improve Brush Border Membrane Morphology In Vivo (Gallus gallus).
LID - 10.3390/nu14030448 [doi]
LID - 448
AB  - Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) , a gluten-free pseudo-cereal , has gainedpopularity over the last decade due to its high nutritional value. Quinoa is arich source of proteins , carbohydrates , fibers , tocopherols (Vitamin E) ,unsaturated fatty acids and a wide range of polyphenols. The study used Gallusgallus intra-amniotic feeding , a clinically validated method , to assess theeffects of quinoa soluble fiber (QSF) and quercetin 3-glucoside (Q3G) versuscontrol. Quercetin is a pharmacologically active polyphenol found in quinoa. Sixgroups (no injection , 18 Ω H2O , 5% inulin , 1% Q3G , 5% QSF , 1% Q3G + 5% QSF) wereassessed for their effect on the brush border membrane (BBM) functionality ,intestinal morphology and cecal bacterial populations. Our results showed asignificant (p < 0.05) improvement in BBM morphology , particularly goblet andPaneth cell numbers , in the group administered with quinoa and quercetin.However , there were no significant changes seen in the expression of the genesassessed both in the duodenum and liver between any of the treatment groups.Furthermore , fibrous quinoa increased the concentration of probiotic L. plantarumpopulations compared to the control (H2O). In conclusion , quercetin and quinoafiber consumption has the potential to improve intestinal morphology and modulatethe microbiome.

TI  - Trolox prevents high glucose-induced apoptosis in rat myocardial H9c2 cells byregulating GLUT-4 and antioxidant defense mechanism.
PG  - 1876-1895
LID - 10.1002/iub.2133 [doi]
AB  - Redox imbalance due to hyperglycemia is a causative factor for an increasedgeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that leads to mitochondrialdysfunction and the release of cytochrome-c. The aim of the present study is toelucidate the functional role of oxidative stress (OS) in the induction ofapoptosis in H9c2 cells in the hyperglycemic state through glucose transporter-4(GLUT-4) regulation and antioxidant status. H9c2 cells were incubated with 15 ,24 , and 33 mM glucose for 24 , 48 , and 72 hr to induce hyperglycemic stress.Hyperglycemic episodes have significantly influenced GLUT-4 mRNA regulation ,depleted glutathione (GSH) and its associated enzymes , reduced cellularantioxidant enzymes (AOEs) , caused nuclear condensation , and induced apoptosis byactivating caspase-9 and 3 and annexin V binding in a concentration andduration-dependent manner. Trolox pretreatment significantly enhanced the GLUT-4mRNA and antioxidant defense mechanism , suppressed nuclear condensation , andprevented cytochrome-c release , thereby reducing mitochondrial-dependentapoptosis. The present study shows that the toxic effect of high glucose issignificantly regulated and that OS induction can be prevented through awater-soluble vitamin E analog "Trolox" treatment.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of differentstabilization treatments-namely , dry-heating , infrared-radiation , andmicrowave-heating-on the nutritional , antinutritional , functional , andbioactivity attributes of rice bran (RB). Among the heating treatments ,infrared-radiation exerted the strongest inactivation , resulting in 34.7%residual lipase activity. All the stabilization methods were found to beeffective in the reduction of antinutrients , including phytates , oxalate ,saponins , and trypsin inhibitors. No adverse effect of stabilization was noted onchemical composition and fatty acid profile of RB. Instead , stabilization by allheat treatments caused a significant decrease of vitamin E and total phenolicscontent in RB; the same trend was observed for the antioxidant activity asevaluated by the DPPH test. The antioxidant activity , as evaluated by ABTS andFRAP tests , and water absorption capacity were improved by the stabilization ofRB , whereas the oil absorption capacity and emulsifying properties decreased.Microwave-heating enhanced the foaming properties , whereas infrared-radiationimproved the water solubility index and swelling power of RB. Consequently ,treatment of RB with infrared-radiation has a potential for industrialization toinactivate the lipase and improve some functional properties of this material foruses as a nutraceutical ingredient in food and cosmetic products.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prepare vitamin E polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate(TPGS)-modified insulin-loaded liposomes (T-LPs/INS) and evaluate its safety ,corneal permeability , ocular surface retention and pharmacokinetics in rabbiteyes. METHODS: The safety of the preparation was investigated in human cornealendothelial cells (HCECs) using CCK8 assay and live/dead cell staining. In theocular surface retention study , 6 rabbits were randomized into 2 equal groups forapplication of fluorescein sodium dilution or T-LPs/INS labeled with fluoresceinin both eyes , which were photographed under cobalt blue light at different timepoints. In the cornea penetration test , another 6 rabbits divided into 2 groupsfor application of Nile red diluent or T-LPs/INS labeled with Nile red in botheyes , after which the corneas were harvested for microscopic observation. In thepharmacokinetic study , 2 groups of rabbits (n=24) were treated with eye drops ofT-LPs/INS or insulin , and the aqueous humor and cornea were collected atdifferent time points for measurement of insulin concentrations using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. DAS2 software was used to analyze the pharmacokineticparameters. RESULTS: The prepared T-LPs/INS showed good safety in cultured HCECs.Corneal permeability assay and fluorescence tracer ocular surface retention assaydemonstrated a significantly higher corneal permeability of T-LPs/INS with aprolonged drug residence in the cornea. In the pharmacokinetic study , insulinconcentrations in the cornea at 6 , 15 , 45 , 60 , and 120 min (P < 0.01) and in theaqueous humor at 15 , 45 , 60 , and 120 min after dosing were significantly higherin T-LPs/INS group. The changes in insulin concentrations in the cornea andaqueous humor were consistent with a two-compartment model in T-LPs/INS group andwith the one-compartment model in the insulin group. CONCLUSION: The preparedT-LPs/INS shows an improved corneal permeability , ocular surface retentioncapacity and eye tissue concentration of insulin in rabbits.

AB  - We applied computing-as-a-service to the unattended system-agnostic miscibilityprediction of the pharmaceutical surfactants , Vitamin E TPGS and Tween 80 , withCopovidone VA64 polymer at temperature relevant for the pharmaceutical hot meltextrusion process. The computations were performed in lieu of running exhaustivehot melt extrusion experiments to identify surfactant-polymer miscibility limits.The computing scheme involved a massively parallelized architecture for moleculardynamics and free energy perturbation from which binodal , spinodal , andmechanical mixture critical points were detected on molar Gibbs free energyprofiles at 180 °C. We established tight agreement between the computed stability(miscibility) limits of 9.0 and 10.0 wt% vs. the experimental 7 and 9 wt% for theVitamin E TPGS and Tween 80 systems , respectively , and identified differentdestabilizing mechanisms applicable to each system. This paradigm supports thatcomputational stability prediction may serve as a physically meaningful ,resource-efficient , and operationally sensible digital twin to experimentalscreening tests of pharmaceutical systems. This approach is also relevant toamorphous solid dispersion drug delivery systems , as it can identify criticalstability points of active pharmaceutical ingredient/excipient mixtures.

AB  - Objective: To understand how diet quality affects chronic disease etiology , theassociations of 4 a priori diet quality indices with blood levels oflipid-soluble micronutrients and biomarkers of inflammation , lipid , and glucosemetabolism were examined in 5 ethnic groups.Methods: In a cross-sectional design ,the Adiposity Phenotype Study , a subset of the Multiethnic Cohort in Hawaii andLos Angeles , recruited participants of white , African American , Native Hawaiian ,Japanese American , and Latino ancestry. A total of 896 men and 910 womencompleted a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire andanthropometric measurements and donated a fasting blood sample. Using generallinear models , covariate-adjusted mean levels of lipid-soluble micronutrients(total carotenes , lycopene , total tocopherols , total lutein , cryptoxanthins) ,biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] , tumor necrosisfactor-[Formula: see text]) , adipokines (adiponectin , leptin) , lipids (totalcholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] , triglycerides) , andglucose metabolism (glucose , insulin , homeostatic model assessment of insulinresistance [HOMA-IR]) were computed across tertiles of 4 a priori dietary indicesHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 , Alternative HEI (AHEI)-2010 , alternateMediterranean Diet (aMED) , Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH); trendswere evaluated in models with diet quality scores as continuousvariables.Results: With better diet quality , levels of carotenes , lutein ,cryptoxanthin , adiponectin , and HDL-C were significantly higher (p(trend) <0.01) , whereas levels of CRP , leptin , total cholesterol , triglycerides , glucose ,insulin , and HOMA-IR were inversely associated (p(trend) < 0.05) with dietquality. With the exception of cryptoxanthins and triglycerides , the associationswere consistent across ethnic groups.Conclusions: These findings confirm theassociation between diet quality and nutrition-related biomarkers and support theidea that a high-quality diet positively influences biologic pathways involved inchronic disease etiology across different ethnic groups.

AB  - δ-tocotrienol (DT3) , a member of vitamin E family , has been shown to have apotent radio-protective effect. However , its application as a radioprotectant islimited , at least in part , by its short plasma elimination half-life and lowbioavailability. In an effort to increase the metabolic stability of DT3 , adeuterium substituted DT3 derivative , d(6)-DT3 , was designed and synthesized.d(6)-DT3 showed improved in vitro and in vivo metabolic stability compared toDT3. The unexpected lower potency of d(6)-DT3 in inducing granulocyte-colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) production in mouse revealed that the metabolite(s) ofDT3 might play a major role in inducing G-CSF induction.

TI  - The effect of surface treatment on the brain delivery of curcumin nanosuspension:in vitro and in vivo studies.
PG  - 5477-5490
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S199624 [doi]
AB  - Background: Curcumin , a bioactive component with multiple characteristics , hasbeen shown to have many therapeutic effects. However , there are severallimitations regarding the use of curcumin such as instability , low solubility ,poor bioavailability , and rapid elimination. Different approaches have been usedto solve these problems. Materials and methods: In this study , surface-modifiednanosuspension (NS) is investigated as a novel brain delivery system. Twodifferent methods were used for the preparation of nanosuspensions with twodifferent stabilizers. The surface of the nanosuspensions was coated withD-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1,000 succinate (TPGS) and Tween 80 usingphysical adsorption. Curcumin NSs were prepared using two different top-downtechniques by high-pressure homogenizer and probe sonicator. A validatedsensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatography method usingfluorescence detection was used for the determination and quantification ofcurcumin. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of curcumin NSs and solutionsafter intravenous administration in rats were studied. Results: Higher levels ofcurcumin in the brain were detected when Tween 80-coated NS was used comparedwith the curcumin solution and TPGS coated NS (TPGS-NS) (P-value<0.05).Absorption of ApoE and/or B by Tween 80-coated nanoparticles (NPs) from the bloodwere caused transferring of these NPs into the brain using receptor-mediatedendocytosis. Distribution of TPGS-NS in the brain compared with the curcuminsolution was higher (P-value<0.05). Higher levels of curcumin concentration inthe liver , spleen , and lung were also observed with TPGS-NS. Conclusion: Theresults of this study indicate that the surface-coating of NSs by Tween 80 may beused to improve the biodistribution of curcumin in the brain.

AB  - Manganese-zinc ferrite (MZF) is known as high-performance magnetic material andhas been used in many fields and development. In the biomedical applications , thebiocompatible MZF formulation attracted much attention. In this study ,water-soluble amphiphilic vitamin E (TPGS , d-alpha-tocopheryl poly(ethyleneglycol 1000) succinate) formulated MZF nanoparticles were synthesized to serve asboth a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent and a vehicle for creatingmagnetically induced hyperthermia against cancer. The MZF nanoparticles weresynthesized from a metallic acetylacetonate in an organic phase and furthermodified with TPGS using an emulsion and solvent-evaporation method. Theresulting TPGS-modified MZF nanoparticles exhibited a dual-contrast ability , witha longitudinal relaxivity (35.22 s(-1) mM Fe(-1)) and transverse relaxivity(237.94 s(-1) mM Fe(-1)) that were both higher than Resovist(®). Furthermore , theTPGS-assisted MZF formulation can be used for hyperthermia treatment tosuccessfully suppress cell viability and tumor growth after applying analternating current (AC) electromagnetic field at lower amplitude. Thus , theTPGS-assisted MZF theranostics can not only be applied as a potential contrastagent for MRI but also has potential for use in hyperthermia treatments.

TI  - Development of Polymeric Micelles for Combined Delivery of Luteolin andDoxorubicin for Cancer Therapy.
PG  - 4717-4730
LID - 10.7150/jca.96402 [doi]
AB  - Background: Luteolin (LUT) is a bioactive compound with several pharmacologicalactivities including anticancer effect. Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracyclinechemotherapeutic drug that have proven to be effective in treating various typesof cancers. Polymeric micelles (PMs) containing biologically active materialshave emerged as prospective dosage forms with high drug-loading , which can addtherapeutic benefit to the poorly water-soluble compounds and novel chemicalentities. PMs are effective in delivering several drugs , such as anticancerdrugs , antifungal drugs , flavonoids and drugs targeting the brain. The aim of thecurrent study is to develop PMs for LUT and DOX as a combined delivery system forcancer therapy. Methods: PMs were prepared using 2.5% of each of LUT and DOX withvarying compositions of Poloxamer 188 , Poloxamer 407 , Vitamin E (TPGS) , Poloxamer123 and Gellucire 44/14 at room temperature. Particle size , polydispersity index ,zeta potential , were achieved using Zetasizer Nano particle size analyzer and thesizes were further confirmed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Prepared PMs were further characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) andfourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). An MTT assay was performed onbreast cancer (MCF-7) cells and liver cancer (HepG2) cells to determine thecytotoxic effect of the different PMs formulations. Results: PMs weresuccessfully developed and optimized using 74.3% Poloxamer 407 with 20.7% VitaminE (TPGS) , and 70% Poloxamer 407 with 25% Gellucire 44/14 , respectively. Thedroplet size and polydispersity index were found to be 62.03 ± 3.99 nm , 91.96 ±5.80 nm and 0.33 ± 0.05 , 0.59± 0.03 , respectively for PMs containing TPGS andGellucire 44/14. Zeta potentials of the PMs containing TPGS and Gellucire 44/14were recorded as -2.27 ±0.11mV and -7.78 ± 0.10 mV , respectively. The PMs showeda spherical structure with approximately 50-90 nm range evident by TEM analysis.The PXRD spectra of PMs powder presented the amorphization of LUT and DOX. TheFTIR spectra of LUT-loaded and DOX-loaded PMs were identical , suggestingconsistent PMs composition. The MTT assay showed that the representative combineddrug loaded PMs treatment led to a reduction in the viability of MCF-7 and HepG2cells compared to drug free PMs and pure LUT , DOX alone. Conclusions: PMs withLUT and DOX exhibited significant cytotoxic effects against breast and livercancer cells and could thus be an important new pharmaceutical formulation totreat cancer.

TI  - Orally Administered Halofuginone-Loaded TPGS Polymeric Micelles AgainstTriple-Negative Breast Cancer: Enhanced Absorption and Efficacy with ReducedToxicity and Metastasis.
PG  - 2475-2491
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S352538 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Halofuginone (HF)-loaded TPGS polymeric micelles (HTPM) weresuccessfully fabricated using the thin-film hydration technique. HTPM viaintravenous injection have been demonstrated to exert an excellent anticancereffect against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and subcutaneousxenografts. In the present study , we further explored the potential treatmenteffect and mechanism of orally administered HTPM alone and in combination withsurgical therapy on TNBC in subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models. METHODS:Herein , the stability and in vitro release behavior of HTPM were first evaluatedin the simulated gastrointestinal fluids. Caco-2 cell monolayers were then usedto investigate the absorption and transport patterns of HF with/withoutencapsulation in TPGS polymeric micelles. Subsequently , the therapeutic effect oforally administered HTPM was checked on subcutaneous xenografts of TNBC in nudemice. Ultimately , orally administered HTPM , combined with surgical therapy , wereutilized to treat orthotopic TNBC in nude mice. RESULTS: Our data confirmed thatHTPM exhibited good stability and sustained release in the simulatedgastrointestinal fluids. HF was authenticated to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein(P-gp) , and its permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers was markedly enhancedvia heightening intracellular absorption and inhibiting P-gp efflux due toencapsulation in TPGS polymeric micelles. Compared with HF alone , HTPM showedstronger tumor-suppressing effects in subcutaneous xenografts of MDA-MB-231 cellswhen orally administered. Moreover , compared with HTPM or surgical therapy alone ,peroral HTPM combined with partial surgical excision synergistically retarded thegrowth of orthotopic TNBC. Fundamentally , HTPM orally administered at thetherapeutic dose did not cause any pathological injury , while HF alone led toweight loss and jejunal bleeding in the investigated mice. CONCLUSION: Takentogether , HTPM could be applied as a potential anticancer agent for TNBC by oraladministration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) , particularly n-3 , have beneficialeffects on human health , and for this reason foodstuffs with increased content ofn-3 PUFA are now very common and widely available. DESIGN: This study wasconducted to investigate the effect of the duration of a flaxseed diet on Pekingduck's growth performance , antioxidant status , gene expression , and fatty acidprofile of the meat. A total of 792 12-day-old white Peking ducks were dividedinto four groups. In the control group , animals were provided with a basal diet.In the three experimental groups , animals were fed a 10% flax seed diet withvitamin E at 13 , 23 , and 33 days of age for 30 , 20 , and 10 days , respectively.RESULTS: The growth performance of the ducks decreased with flaxseed diet'sduration. Both body weight and body weight gain decreased linearly while Feedconversion ratios (FCR) increased in the group of ducks fed flaxseed compared tocontrol ducks. Serum triglycerides (TG) , very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) , lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) , and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)linearly decreased while high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) andlipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels increased by feeding flaxseed up to 30 days. Theexpression of lipin-1 gene (LPIN-1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) linearlyincreased in ducks fed flaxseed for 30 days. Linolenic acid (n-3) and itslong-chain metabolites like eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA) , eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) , docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) , and total n-3 fatty acids (FA) linearlyincreased while the ratio of n-6 to n-3 was reduced with increased duration offlaxseed supplementation. CONCLUSION: Overall , we found that increasing theduration of flaxseed diet with vitamin E for more than 10 days had a mild adverseeffect on duck's growth performance but enrichedits meat with long-chain PUFA anddecreased the n-6 to n-3 ratio , providing quality meat for health-consciousconsumers. A period of 20 days is good for producing n-3 enriched Peking duckmeat and skin.

AB  - In the present research , we have evaluated the association between patterns ofnutrient intake and obesity. The present cross-sectional study recruited 850adults aged between 20-59 years old. Dietary intakes were assessed with three24-hour recalls. As well , data on anthropometric measures were collected. Generalobesity was specified as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2). Factor analysis wasconducted , and followed by a varimax rotation , was performed to extract majornutrient patterns. Our analysis identified three major nutrient patterns: Thefirst nutrient pattern was characterized by the high consumption of saturatedfatty acids (SFAs) , protein , vitamins B(1) , B(2) , B(6) , B(5) , B(3) , B(12) , Zinc ,and iron. The second nutrient pattern was rich in total fat , polyunsaturatedfatty acids , monounsaturated fatty acids , SFAs , oleic acid , linolenic acid , zinc ,vitamin E , α-tocopherol , and β-carotene. The third one was greatly loaded withprotein , carbohydrate , potassium , magnesium , phosphorus , calcium , vitamin C , andfolate. Women in the third quintile of the first pattern were less likely to begenerally obese in the fully adjusted model (odds ratio , 0.44; 95% confidenceinterval , 0.25-0.75). None of the other nutrient patterns had a significantassociation with obesity , even after adjusting for confounders. Adherence to anutrient pattern rich in water-soluble vitamins was significantly associated witha greater chance of general obesity among women. Further studies in otherpopulations , along with future prospective studies , are required to confirm thesefindings.

TI  - Preparation and antitumor evaluation of hinokiflavone hybrid micelles withmitochondria targeted for lung adenocarcinoma treatment.
PG  - 565-574
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2020.1748760 [doi]
AB  - Hinokiflavone (HF) is a natural biflavonoid extracted from medicinal plants suchas Selaginella tamariscina and Platycladus orientalis. HF plays a crucial role inthe treatment of several cancers. However , its poor solubility , instability , andlow bioavailability have limited its use. In this study , soluplus/d-α-tocopherolacid polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS)/dequalinium (DQA) was applied toimprove the solubilization efficiency and stability of HF. HF hybrid micelleswere prepared via thin-film hydration method. The physicochemical properties ofmicelles , including particle size , zeta potential , encapsulation efficiency , drugloading , CMC value , and stability were investigated. The in vitro cytotoxicityassay showed that the cytotoxicity of the HF hybrid micelles was higher than thatof free HF. In addition , the HF hybrid micelles improved anticancer efficacy andinduced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis , which is associated with the high levelsof ROS inducing decreased mitochondrial membrane potential , promoting apoptosisof tumor cells. Furthermore , in vivo tumor suppression , smaller tumor volume andincreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins were found in nude mice treatedwith HF hybrid micelles , suggesting that HF hybrid micelles had stronger tumorsuppressive activity compared with free HF. In summary , HF hybrid micellesdeveloped in this study enhanced antitumor effect , which may be a potential drugdelivery system for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.

AB  - Curcumin (CCM) has many potential uses in anticancer chemotherapy , but its lowwater solubility poses a major problem , preventing its translation into clinicaluse. TPGS is a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E that acts as a surfactantwith the ability to form micellar nanoparticles in water. More importantly , TPGSacts as a potent antioxidant that can neutralize intracellular reactive oxygenspecies (ROS). In this study , we solubilized CCM with TPGS using thin-filmrehydration to prepare aqueous formulations containing CCM at clinically relevantconcentrations. We found that the minimal TPGS:CCM ratio for producingnanoparticles was 5:1 (w/w): at or above this ratio , stable nanoparticles formedwith an average particle diameter of 12 nm. CCM was released from TPGS/CCMmicelles in simulated colonic and gastric fluids. These TPGS/CCM nanoparticleswere shown to decrease intracellular ROS levels and apoptosis and inhibitedmigration of HT-29 human colon cancer cells more potently than free CCM.Pharmacokinetic analysis showed TPGS/CCM to be more bioavailable than free CCMafter oral administration to rats. Our results suggest that TPGS/CCM may increasetherapeutic efficacy of CCM against colon cancer and merits further investigationin a clinical setting.

AB  - PURPOSE: The present study is an attempt to develop a vitamin E loaded naringenin(NRG) Nanoemulsion (NE) for direct nose-to-brain delivery for better managementof Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: The optimized NE was evaluated for efficacyin PD using multiple behavioral studies (including narrow beam test , muscularcoordination test , grip strength test , forced swimming test , and akinesia test)in a rat model. Optimized formulation was evaluated for droplet size ,polydispersity index (PDI) , refractive index , transmittance , zeta potential , andviscosity. RESULTS: Optimized NE had a droplet size of 38.70 ± 3.11nm , PDI of0.14 ± 0.0024 , refractive index of 1.43 ± 0.01 , transmittance of 98.12 ± 0.07 % ,zeta potential of - 27.4 ± 0.14 mV , and viscosity of 19.67 ± 0.25 Pa s.Behavioral studies showed that 6-OHDA induced PD in rats were successfullyreversed when administered with NRG NE intranasally along with the levodopa.While the levels of GSH and SOD were significantly higher , levels of MDA weresignificantly lower in the group treated with NRG NE via intranasal route alongwith levodopa. CONCLUSION: Encouraging results from current study provideevidence for possible efficacy of a novel noninvasive intranasal delivery systemof NRG for management of PD related symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transient hyperphosphatasemia , characterized by isolated highlyelevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the absence of liver or bonedisease , is typically seen in children but rarely in adults. Here we reporthighly elevated ALP activity in a complicated multiple-organ transplant patientdue to benign transient hyperphosphatasemia. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old male hada complicated past medical history including a bilateral lung transplant forcystic fibrosis in 2006 , colonic resection due to colon cancer in December 2011and subsequent chemotherapy which ended in June 2022. He also had combined liverand kidney transplant in 2022 at our academic medical center. Post-transplant , hewas treated with triple drug immunosuppressant therapy (tacrolimus , mycophenolicacid , and prednisone). Although his alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was 83U/L , it continued to increase three months after combined liver and kidneytransplant even though other liver enzymes were mildly elevated but totalbilirubin remained within their reference ranges. Flecainide was discontinued buthis ALP remained high , peaking at 5904 U/L. Finally , lansoprazole , ergocalciferol(vitamin D2) and vitamin E supplement were discontinued as nonessentialmedications , and coincidently ALP activity started to decline. CONCLUSIONS: Afterruling out all possibilities that may cause elevated ALP , we concluded that thisis a rare case of benign transient hyperphosphatasemia in an adult transplantrecipient.

AB  - Tocopherols (Tocs) are a kind of lipid-soluble substance required for the normalphysiological function of mammals , particularly their antioxidant capacity.Rapeseed (Brassica napus) oil is an important source of exogenous Tocs. However ,the genotypic differences in the total Toc contents , the Toc composition in theseeds , and the molecular markers associated with the seed Toc remain largelyunknown. Here , we selected 290 rapeseed accessions based on the resequencing of991 genomes in a worldwide collection of rapeseed germplasm. The contents of thefour Toc isoforms , namely , α- , β- , γ- , and δ-Tocs , were also measured. Resultsshow that the total Toc content and the γ-/α-Toc ratio varied greatly across theaccessions from 85.34 to 387.00 mg/mg and 0.65 to 5.03 , respectively.Furthermore , we conducted genome-wide association studies on the Tocs , whichidentified 28 and 73 single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associatedwith the variation of total Toc content and γ-/α-Toc ratio , respectively.Bna.C02.VTE4 , a putative orthologue of Arabidopsis VITAMIN E DEFICIENT 4 , wastightly associated with the γ-/α-Toc ratio. This study recommends specificgenetic materials with particularly high total Toc and/or low γ-/α-Toc ratio andthe molecular markers and haplotypes associated with these quality traits forrapeseed breeding.

TI  - Dual drug-loaded polymeric mixed micelles for ovarian cancer: Approach toenhanced therapeutic efficacy of albendazole and paclitaxel.
PG  - e18389
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.18389 [doi]
LID - e18389
AB  - Chemotherapy resistance remains a significant challenge in treating ovariancancer effectively. This study addresses this issue by utilizing a dualdrug-loaded nanomicelle system comprising albendazole (ABZ) and paclitaxel (PTX) ,encapsulated in a novel carrier matrix of D-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000succinate vitamin E (TPGS) , soluplus and folic acid. Our objective was to developand optimize this nanoparticulate delivery system using solvent evaporationtechniques to enhance the therapeutic efficacy against ovarian cancer. Theformulation process involved pre-formulation , formulation , optimization , andcomprehensive characterization of the micelles. Optimization was conductedthrough a 32 factorial design , focusing on the effects of polymer ratios onparticle size , zeta potential , polydispersity index (PDI) and entrapmentefficiency (%EE). The optimal formulation demonstrated improved dilutionstability , as indicated by a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 0.0015 mg/mLfor the TPGS-folic acid conjugate (TPGS-FOL). Extensive characterization includeddifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) , nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) , andFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The release profile exhibited aninitial burst followed by sustained release over 90 h. The cytotoxic potential ofthe formulated micelles was superior to that of the drugs alone , as assessed byMTT assays on SKOV3 ovarian cell lines. Additionally , in vivo studies confirmedthe presence of both drugs in plasma and tumour tissues , suggesting effectivetargeting and penetration. In conclusion , the developed TPGS-Fol-basednanomicelles for co-delivering ABZ and PTX show promising results in overcomingdrug resistance , enhancing solubility , sustaining drug release , and improvingtherapeutic outcomes in ovarian cancer treatment.

AB  - Recently , the chemical compound Bisphenol A (BPA) has been attracting worldwideattention due to its various toxic effects in animals , including reprotoxicity ,neurotoxicity , hepatoxicity , and nephrotoxicity. Here , the midgut of adultDrosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) , an invertebrate model organism , wasemployed to investigate the gastrointestinal toxicity of BPA in D. melanogasterand explore its underlying mechanisms of action in insects. As a result , exposureof flies to 0.5 mM BPA resulted in a dramatic morphological alteration of D.melanogaster midgut and decrease in survival rates and climbing ability of flies.Further study indicated that BPA induced high levels of oxidative stress in D.melanogaster midgut due to the imbalance between the production of reactiveoxygen species and the activities of cellular antioxidant enzymes , includingglutathione-S-transferase , catalase and superoxide dismutase. Oxidative stressinduced by BPA then caused intestinal epithelial cell death and gut barrierdysfunction and elevated gut permeability , leading to oxidative injury of midgutepithelium. Antioxidant vitamin E alleviated midgut injury induced by BPA.Subsequently , BPA-induced oxidative injury of midgut further stimulated theproliferation of intestinal stem cell (ISC) and ISC-mediated midgut regeneration ,but did not alter cell fate determination of ISCs in Drosophila midgut.Meanwhile , activation of Jun N-terminal kinase signal pathway was found to berequired for BPA-induced cell death and tissue regeneration in midgut.Collectively , the present study provided additional evidence from an invertebratemodel organism that BPA exposure induced gastrointestinal toxicity in D.melanogaster and further extended our understanding of the molecular mechanismsmediating BPA toxicity in insects.

LID - 1856
AB  - To date , (14)C tracer studies using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) have notyet resolved lipid-soluble analytes into individual lipoprotein densitysubclasses. The objective of this work was to develop a reliable method forlipoprotein separation and quantitative recovery for biokinetic modelingpurposes. The novel method developed provides the means for use of small volumes(10-200 µL) of frozen plasma as a starting material for continuous isopycniclipoprotein separation within a carbon- and pH-stable analyte matrix , which ,following post-separation fraction clean up , created samples suitable for highlyaccurate (14)C/(12)C isotope ratio determinations by AMS. Manual aspirationachieved 99.2 ± 0.41% recovery of [5-(14)CH(3)]-(2R , 4'R , 8'R)-α-tocopherolcontained within 25 µL plasma recovered in triacylglycerol rich lipoproteins (TRL= Chylomicrons + VLDL) , LDL , HDL , and infranatant (INF) from each of 10 differentsampling times for one male and one female subject , n = 20 total samples. Smallsample volumes of previously frozen plasma and high analyte recoveries make thisan attractive method for AMS studies using newer , smaller footprint AMS equipmentto develop genuine tracer analyses of lipophilic nutrients or compounds in allhuman age ranges.

TI  - The co-injection of antioxidants with foot-and-mouth disease vaccination alteredgrowth performance and blood parameters of finishing Holstein steers.
PG  - 792-799
LID - 10.5713/ajas.18.0609 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate whether the co-injection ofantioxidants together with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccination has thepotential to attenuate the negative effects caused by vaccination in Holsteinfinishing steers. METHODS: A total of 36 finishing Holstein steers (body weight[BW]: 608±45.6 kg , 17 months old) were randomly allocated to one of threetreatments: i) control (CON , only FMD vaccination without any co-injection) , ii)co-injection of commercial non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with FMDvaccination at a ratio of 10:1 (NSAID vol/FMD vaccine vol) as a positive control(PCON) , iii) co-injection of commercial mixture of vitamin E and selenium withFMD vaccination (VITESEL) (1 mL of FMD vaccine+1 mL of antioxidants per 90 kg ofBW). Changes in growth performance and blood parameters because of treatmentswere determined. RESULTS: No significant difference in BW , average daily gain ,and dry matter intake of the steers was observed among the treatments. The FMDvaccination significantly increased white blood cells (WBC) , neutrophils ,platelets , and mean platelet volume (p<0.01) in blood analysis. The count oflymphocyte tended to increase after vaccination (p = 0.08). In blood analysis ,steers in VITESEL tended to have higher numbers of WBC , neutrophils , andplatelets compared to that of other treatments (p = 0.09 , 0.06 , and 0.09 ,respectively). Eosinophils in VITESEL were higher than those in PCON (p<0.01).Among blood metabolites , blood urea nitrogen and aspartate transaminase weresignificantly increased , but cholesterol , alanine transferase , inorganicphosphorus , Mg , and albumin were decreased after FMD vaccination (p<0.01).CONCLUSION: The use of antioxidants in FMD vaccination did not attenuate growthdisturbance because of FMD vaccination. The metabolic changes induced byvaccination were not controlled by the administration of antioxidants. Theprotective function of antioxidants was effective mainly on the cell counts ofleukocytes.

LID - 704691
AB  - Background: Healthy dietary patterns are related to better cognitive health inaging populations. While levels of individual nutrients in neural tissues areindividually associated with cognitive function , the investigation of nutrientpatterns in human brain tissue has not been conducted. Methods: Brain tissueswere acquired from frontal and temporal cortices of 47 centenarians from theGeorgia Centenarian Study. Fat-soluble nutrients (carotenoids , vitamins A , E , K ,and fatty acids [FA]) were measured and averaged from the two brain regions.Nutrient patterns were constructed using principal component analysis. Cognitivecomposite scores were constructed from cognitive assessment from the time pointclosest to death. Dementia status was rated by Global Deterioration Scale (GDS).Pearson's correlation coefficients between NP scores and cognitive compositescores were calculated controlling for sex , education , hypertension , diabetes ,and APOE ε4 allele. Result: Among non-demented subjects (GDS = 1-3 , n = 23) , anutrient pattern higher in carotenoids was consistently associated with betterperformance on global cognition (r = 0.38 , p = 0.070) , memory (r = 0.38 , p =0.073) , language (r = 0.42 , p = 0.046) , and lower depression (r = -0.40 , p =0.090). The findings were confirmed with univariate analysis. Conclusion: Bothmultivariate and univariate analyses demonstrate that brain nutrient patternexplained mainly by carotenoid concentrations is correlated with cognitivefunction among subjects who had no dementia. Investigation of their synergisticroles on the prevention of age-related cognitive impairment remains to beperformed.

AB  - Soil pollution with heavy metals has grown to be a big hassle , leading to theloss in farming production particularly in developing countries like Pakistan ,where no proper channel is present for irrigation and extraction of these toxicheavy metals. The present study aims to ameliorate the damages caused by heavymetal ions (Hg-Mercury) on rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) via a growth regulator(α-tocopherol 150 mg/L) and thermopriming technique at 4 °C and 50 °C to maintainplant agronomical and physiological characteristics. In pot experiments , wedesigned total of 11 treatments viz.( T0 (control) , T1 (Hg4ppm) , T2 (Hg8ppm) , T3(Hg4ppm + 4 °C) , T4 (Hg4ppm + 4 °C + tocopherol (150 m/L)) , T5 (Hg4ppm + 50 °C) ,T6 (Hg4ppm + 50 °C + tocopherol (150 mg/L)) , T7 (Hg8ppm + 4 °C) , T8(Hg8ppm + 4 °C + tocopherol (150 mg/L)) , T9 (Hg8ppm + 50 °C) , T10(Hg8ppm + 50 °C + tocopherol (150 mg/L) the results revealed that chlorophyllcontent at p < 0.05 with growth regulator and antioxidant enzymes such ascatalase , peroxidase , and malondialdehyde enhanced up to the maximum level atT5 = Hg4ppm + 50 °C (50 °C thermopriming under 4 ppm mercuric chloride stress) ,suggesting that high temperature initiate the antioxidant system to reducephotosystem damage. However , protein , proline , superoxide dismutase at p < 0.05 ,and carotenoid , soluble sugar , and ascorbate peroxidase were increasednon-significantly (p > 0.05) 50 °C thermopriming under 8 ppm high mercuricchloride stress (T9 = Hg8ppm + 50 °C) representing the tolerance of selectedspecie by synthesizing osmolytes to resist oxidation mechanism. Furthermore ,reduction in % MC (moisture content) is easily improved with foliar applicationof α-tocopherol and 50 °C thermopriming and 4 ppm heavy metal stress atT6 = Hg4ppm + 50 °C + α-tocopherol (150 mg/L) , with a remarkable increase inplant vigor and germination energy. It has resulted that the inhibitory effect ofonly lower concentration (4 ppm) of heavy metal stress was ameliorated byexogenous application of α-tocopherol and thermopriming technique by synthesizinghigh levels of proline and antioxidant activities in maintaining seedling growthand development on heavy metal contaminated soil.

AB  - Background Little clinical research on new-generation heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC ) in comparison with electronic vaping cigarettes ( EVC ) and traditionaltobacco combustion cigarettes ( TC ) has been reported. We aimed to appraise theacute effects of single use of HNBC  , EVC , and TC in healthy smokers. Methods andResults This was an independent , cross-over , randomized trial in 20 TC smokers ,with allocation to different cycles of HNBC  , EVC  , and TC . All participantsused all types of products , with an intercycle washout of 1 week. End points wereoxidative stress , antioxidant reserve , platelet activation , flow-mediateddilation , blood pressure , and satisfaction scores. Single use of any product ledto an adverse impact on oxidative stress , antioxidant reserve , platelet function ,flow-mediated dilation , and blood pressure. HNBC had less impact than EVC and TCon soluble Nox2-derived peptide (respectively , P=0.004 and 0.001) ,8-iso-prostaglandin F2α- III ( P=0.004 and <0.001) , and vitamin E ( P=0.018 and0.044). HNBC and EVC were equally less impactful than TCs on flow-mediateddilation ( P=0.872 for HNBC versus EVC ) , H(2)O(2) ( P=0.522) , H(2)O(2) breakdownactivity ( P=0.091) , soluble CD 40 ligand ( P=0.849) , and soluble P-selectin (P=0.821). The effect of HNBC and , to a lesser extent EVC  , on blood pressure wasless evident than that of TC  , whereas HNBC appeared more satisfying than EVC(all P<0.05). Conclusions Acute effects of HNBC  , EVC , and TC are different onseveral oxidative stress , antioxidant reserve , platelet function , cardiovascular ,and satisfaction dimensions , with TCs showing the most detrimental changes inclinically relevant features.

AB  - Glimepiride (GMD) is a hypoglycemic agent that has variation in bioavailabilityfor its unexpected absorption. Glimepiride was formulated in a buccal film loadedwith a nanobased formulation to enhance its absorption via buccal mucosa.Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and d-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000succinate-based micelles enhance GMD solubility and improve its permeationthrough the buccal mucosa. The formulation variables were optimized using aBox-Behnken design. These factors , such as the percent of micelles relative toNLC (X (1)) , the percent of Carbopol (X (2)) , and the percent of permeationenhancer (X (3)) , were investigated for their effect on the initial release (Y(1)) and the cumulative release after 6 hours (Y (2)). The optimum levels for X(1) , X (2) , and X (3) were 100% , 0.05% , and 1.8% , respectively. The optimizedformulation revealed that the permeation of GMD from the film was in favor ofmicelles. This optimized film was then coated with ethyl cellulose to direct therelease only through the buccal mucosa. The optimized unidirectional GMDtransmucosal film showed a release of 93.9% of GMD content at 6 hours compared to60.41% of GMD release from the raw GMD film. This finding confirmed thesuitability of transmucosal delivery of GMD via the buccal mucosa.

TI  - Dasatinib self-assembled nanoparticles decorated with hyaluronic acid fortargeted treatment of tumors to overcome multidrug resistance.
PG  - 670-679
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2021.1905751 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) and lack of targeting specificity are the main reasonswhy traditional drug therapies fail and produce toxic side effects in cancerchemotherapy. In order to increase targeting specificity and maximize therapeuticefficacy , new intelligent drug delivery systems are needed. In this study , weprepared the hyaluronic acid (HA) conjugated dasatinib (DAS) and D-α-tocopherolacid polyethylene glycolsuccinate (TPGS) copolymer nanoparticles (THD-NPs). Thewater solubility of the hydrophobic drug DAS was improved by chemically linkingwith HA. HA can bind to the over-expressed CD44 protein of tumor cells toincrease targeting specificity , TPGS can inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein(P-gp) , and increase the intracellular accumulation of drugs. The prepareddrug-loaded nanoparticle has a particle size of 82.23 ± 1.07 nm with goodin vitro stability. Our in vitro studies showed that THD-NPs can be released morerapidly in a weakly acidic environment (pH = 5.5) than in a normal physiologicalenvironment (pH = 7.4) , which can realize the selective release of nanoparticlesin tumor cells. Compared to free drugs , THD-NPs showed more efficient cellularuptake , effectively increased the cytotoxic effect of DAS on nasopharyngealcarcinoma HNE1 cells drug resistance HNE1/DDP cells and increased theaccumulation of drugs in HNE1/DDP cells , which may be due to the inhibitoryeffect of TPGS on the efflux function of P-gp. In vivo experiments showed thatTHD-NPs can effectively inhibit tumor growth without obvious side effects. Inconclusion , the targeted and pH-sensitive nanosystem , we designed has greatpotential to overcome drug resistance and increase therapeutic effects in cancertreatment.

AB  - Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome also known as neutral lipid storage disease is a raremultisystemic autosomal recessive disorder. It is mostly encountered in patientsof Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origin. Most patients are brought to medicalattention secondary to dermatological manifestations namely ichthyosis. Here , wereport a 10-year-old Kurdish male patient with ichthyosis , who was referred topediatric liver clinic for transaminase elevation of unknown etiology despiteelaborate workup. Histological findings on liver biopsy were consistent withnonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Genetic testing identified homozygous mutationC.776G>A (p.G259D) in the Abhydrolase domain containing 5 gene on chromosome 3described in patients with Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome. After the initiation of adiet with high medium chain triglycerides/long chain triglycerides ratio , aerobicexercise , and vitamin E , the patient liver enzymes improved. Due to debilitatingichthyosis , he was started on acitretin therapy that was discontinued due totransaminases elevation. Patient is currently stable and doing well.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: the multifaceted nature of food craving mirrors the complexityunderlying the development of eating disorders. OBJECTIVES: the study aimed toinvestigate the impact of a 6-week dietary and lifestyle intervention on foodcravings , eating behaviors , and changes in physical and biochemical measuresamong women. METHODS: this study constitutes a behavior modificationinvestigation involving a cohort of 35 female participants who soughtconsultation at a private nutrition counseling facility. At first , anthropometricand biochemical data were recorded; Information Form , Food CravingQuestionnaire-Trait Scale (FCQ-T) , Three-Factor Eating Scale (TFEQ-R21) wereapplied and 3-Day Food Consumption Records were taken. After 6 weeks of dietitianfollow-up , the data collection tools were repeated and the individuals werecompared with the baseline. RESULTS: after 6-week follow-up , according to theexamination of the food consumption records , differences in daily energy , fat ,monounsaturated fatty acid , fibre , vitamin E , potassium , magnesium , iron intakelevels were found significant (p < 0.05). Differences in body weight , body massindex (BMI) , waist/height ratio , fat mass , fat ratio and fasting glucose , HbA1c ,total cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL , AST , TSH , free T3 , free T4 levels werefound significant (p < 0.05). According to the FCQ-T evaluation; differences intotal and nine sub-dimension scores of the scale were found significant (p <0.001). According to the TFEQ-R21 evaluation; differences in cognitive restraint ,emotional eating and uncontrolled eating scores were found significant (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: a successful 6-week dietary and lifestyle intervention withimprovement in anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters iseffective in reducing food cravings and regulating eating behaviours.

AB  - The objective of this study was to synthesize and characterize a set ofbiodegradable block copolymers based on TPGS-block-poly(ε-caprolactone)(TPGS-b-PCL) and to assess their self-assembled structures as a nanodeliverysystem for paclitaxel (PAX). The conjugation of PCL to TPGS was hypothesized toincrease the stability and the drug solubilization characteristics of TPGSmicelles. TPGS-b-PCL copolymer with various PCL/TPGS ratios were synthesized viaring opening bulk polymerization of ε-caprolactone using TPGS , with differentmolecular weights of PEG (1-5 kDa) , as initiators and stannous octoate as acatalyst. The synthesized copolymers were characterized using (1)H NMR , GPC ,FTIR , XRD , and DSC. Assembly of block copolymers was achieved via the cosolventevaporation method. The self-assembled structures were characterized for theirsize , polydispersity , and CMC using dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. Theresults from the spectroscopic and thermal analyses confirmed the successfulsynthesis of the copolymers. Only copolymers that consisted of TPGS with PEGmolecular weights ≥ 2000 Da were able to self-assemble and form nanocarriers of≤200 nm in diameter. Moreover , TPGS(2000)-b-PCL(4000) , TPGS(3500)-b-PCL(7000) ,and TPGS(5000)-b-PCL(15000) micelles enhanced the aqueous solubility of PAX from0.3 µg/mL up to 88.4 ug/mL in TPGS(5000)-b-PCL(15000). Of the abovementionedmicellar formulations , TPGS(5000)-b-PCL(15000) showed the slowest in vitrorelease of PAX. Specifically , the PAX-loaded TPGS(5000)-b-PCL(15000) micellarformulation showed less than 10% drug release within the first 12 h , and around36% cumulative drug release within 72 h compared to 61% and 100% PAX release ,respectively , from the commercially available formulation (Ebetaxel(®)) at thesame time points. Our results point to a great potential for TPGS-b-PCL micellesto efficiently solubilize and control the release of PAX.

AB  - Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) attract great attention in pharmacy ,diagnostics , and biomedical areas due to benefits like localization and uniqueinteractions of NPs with biocomponents of living cells. In the present paper , weprepared and characterized two kinds of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated withα-tocopherol-like residues: 1A were soluble in non-polar solvents and theirantioxidant activity was tested during the peroxidation of a model hydrocarbon ina homogeneous system , whereas nanoparticles 1B were soluble in polar solvents andwere applied as antioxidants in micellar and liposomal systems. The effectivenessof 1A is comparable to 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-ol (PMHC , an analogue ofα-tocopherol). Taking the results of the kinetic measurements , we calculated anaverage number of 2150 chromanol residues per one NP , suggesting a thick organiccoating around the metal core. In heterogeneous systems , the peroxidation ofmethyl linoleate dispersed in Triton X-100 micelles or DMPC liposomes resulted inthe observation that 1B (545 chromanol residues per one NP) was active enough toeffectively inhibit peroxidation in a micellar system , but in a liposomal system ,1B behaved as a retardant (no clear induction period). The importance ofmicroenvironment in heterogeneous systems on the overall antioxidant activity ofnanoparticles is discussed.

TI  - Bioadhesive polymer/lipid hybrid nanoparticles as oral delivery system ofraloxifene with enhancive intestinal retention and bioavailability.
PG  - 252-260
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2021.1872742 [doi]
AB  - Raloxifene (RLX) is a second-generation selective estrogen receptor modulatorused to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. RLX fails to be developedinto injectable dosage forms due to poor solubility. Although oral formulationsare clinically available , the lower bioavailability (<2%) embarrasses thepharmaceutists. This work reported a bioadhesive nanosystem intended for oraldelivery of RLX to enhance its oral bioavailability and address the formulationchallenge. The bioadhesive nanosystem refers to polymer-lipid hybridnanoparticles made up of Carbopol 940 , glyceryl distearate , and TGPS. RLX wassolidly encapsulated into bioadhesive nanoparticles (bNPs) through ananoprecipitation technique along with synchronous desalting of RLX·HCl. Theresultant RLX-loaded bNPs (RLX-bNPs) were characterized by particle size , ζpotential , morphology , and entrapment efficiency. The in vitro release andin vivo oral bioavailability of RLX-bNPs in rats were comparatively investigatedwith RLX-loaded common lipid nanoparticles (RLX-cNPs). The preferred formulationpossesses a particle size of 150 nm around with a polydispersity index (PDI) of0.282. RLX-bNPs exhibited slower drug release than RLX-cNPs owing to the presenceof an adhesive layer. After oral administration , RLX-bNPs resulted in significantenhancement in the bioavailability of RLX , up to 556.9% relative to RLXsuspensions , while it was merely 244.7% for RLX-cNPs. Cellular testing and exvivo transport imaging demonstrated that bNPs were endowed with excellentintestinal epithelial affinity and absorbability. Our study affords analternative option for designing a suitable oral delivery system specific toamphiphobic drugs like RLX·HCl.

AB  - Water stress is a major problem to fulfill the world food demand and to solve theproblem of malnutrition. Different strategies are being used to solve theseproblems including the fertigation of plants with different biochemical atdifferent growth stages. The present study was conducted for the induction ofdrought tolerance in field grown wheat for better yield and nutritional qualitythrough foliar spray of α-tocopherol (α-Toc) at start of reproductive stage.Water stress was maintained based on number of irrigation. Three levels of α-Toc0.001 , 0.01 and 0.1 mM were applied as foliar spray. Water stress significantlyreduced the biomass production that associated with the decreased photosyntheticpigments , water relation , photosynthetic efficiency , but increased the lipidperoxidation , leaf relative membrane permeability , activities of antioxidantenzymes and the contents of phenolic , flavonoids , α-toc and ASA. Water stressalso negatively effected the different yield attributes and seed nutrientquality. Foliar fertigation of wheat plants with α-Toc significantly improved thewater stress tolerance of wheat plants in term of improvement in growth and seedyield associated with improved water relations , photosynthetic efficiency ,contents of photosynthetic pigments and improvement in antioxidative defencemechanism (enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants). Fertigation of waterstressed wheat plants with α-Toc also improved the seed nutritional quality interms of the contents of seed phenolics , flavonoids , activities of antioxidantenzymes and the content of α- , β- and γ-tocopherols. In conclusion , it was foundthat fertigation of water stressed wheat plants not only improved the waterstress tolerance but also improved the seed yield and nutritional quality thatwill not only be helpful for the improvement in wheat yield that also be a stepto solve the problem of malnutrition through the bio-fertification of α-Toc.

AB  - Water being a vital part of cell protoplasm plays a significant role insustaining life on earth; however , drastic changes in climatic conditions lead tolimiting the availability of water and causing other environmental adversities.α-tocopherol being a powerful antioxidant , protects lipid membranes from thedrastic effects of oxidative stress by deactivating singlet oxygen , reducingsuperoxide radicals , and terminating lipid peroxidation by reducing fatty acylperoxy radicals under drought stress conditions. A pot experiment was conductedand two groups of lentil cultivar (Punjab-2009) were exposed to 20 and 25 days ofdrought induced stress by restricting the availability of water after 60th day ofgermination. Both of the groups were sprinkled with α-tocopherol 100 , 200 and 300mg/L. Induced water deficit stress conditions caused a pronounced decline ingrowth parameters including absolute growth rate (AGR) , leaf area index (LAI) ,leaf area ratio (LAR) , root shoot ratio (RSR) , relative growth rate (RGR) ,chlorophyll a , b , total chlorophyll content , carotenoids , and soluble proteincontent (SPC) which were significantly enhanced by exogenously appliedα-tocopherol. Moreover , a significant increase was reported in total prolinecontent (TPC) , soluble sugar content (SSC) , glycine betaine (GB) content ,endogenous tocopherol levels , ascorbate peroxidase (APX) , catalase (CAT)peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. On the contrary ,exogenously applied α-tocopherol significantly reduced the concentrations ofmalondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In conclusion , it wasconfirmed that exogenous application of α-tocopherol under drought induced stressregimes resulted in membrane protection by inhibiting lipid peroxidation ,enhancing the activities of antioxidative enzymes (APX , CAT , POD , and SOD) andaccumulation of osmolytes such as glycine betaine , proline and sugar.Consequently , modulating different growth , physiological and biochemicalattributes.

AB  - Antioxidant small molecules can prevent or delay the oxidative damage caused byfree radicals. Herein , a structure-based hybridization of two naturalantioxidants (caffeic acid and melatonin) afforded a novel hybrid series ofindole-based amide analogues which was synthesized with potential antioxidantproperties. A multiple-step scheme of in vitro radical scavenging assays wascarried out to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds.The results of the DPPH assay demonstrated that the indole-based caffeic acidamides are more active free radical scavenging agents than their benzamideanalogues. Compared to Trolox , a water-soluble analogue of vitamin E , compounds3a , 3f , 3h , 3j , and 3m were found to have excellent DPPH radical scavengingactivities with IC(50) values of 95.81 ± 1.01 , 136.8 ± 1.04 , 86.77 ± 1.03 , 50.98± 1.05 , and 67.64 ± 1.02 µM. Three compounds out of five (3f , 3j , and 3m) showeda higher capacity to neutralize the radical cation ABTS(•+) more than Trolox withIC(50) values of 14.48 ± 0.68 , 19.49 ± 0.54 , and 14.92 ± 0.30 µM , respectively.Compound 3j presented the highest antioxidant activity with a FRAP value of4774.37 ± 137.20 μM Trolox eq/mM sample. In a similar way to the FRAP assay , thebest antioxidant activity against the peroxyl radicals was demonstrated bycompound 3j (10,714.21 ± 817.76 μM Trolox eq/mM sample). Taken together , compound3j was validated as a lead hybrid molecule that could be optimized to maximizeits antioxidant potency for the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases.

LID - 10.3390/molecules24040710 [doi]
LID - 710
AB  - This study investigated the effects of α-tocopherol (α-TOH) on thephysicochemical properties of sturgeon surimi during 16-week storage at -18 °C.An aliquot of 0.1% (w/w) of α-TOH was added into the surimi and subjected tofrozen storage , and 8% of a conventional cryoprotectant (4% sorbitol and 4%sucrose , w/w) was used as a positive control. Based on total viable count , pH andwhiteness , α-TOH exhibited a better protection for frozen sturgeon surimi thancryoprotectant during frozen storage. According to soluble protein content ,carbonyl content , total sulfhydryl content , and surface hydrophobicity , α-TOH andcryoprotectant showed the same effects on retarding changes of proteins. Theresults of breaking force , deformation , gel strength , water-holding capacity andmicrostructure of sturgeon surimi indicated that the gel properties of frozensturgeon surimi were retained by α-TOH. Our results suggest that α-TOH is anattractive candidate to maintain the quality of sturgeon surimi during frozenstorage.

TI  - Development and Characterization of Curcumin-Loaded TPGS/F127/P123 PolymericMicelles as a Potential Therapy for Colorectal Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25147577 [doi]
LID - 7577
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prominent cancer worldwide , and thesecond leading cause of cancer death. Poor outcomes and limitations of currenttreatments fuel the search for new therapeutic options. Curcumin (CUR) is oftenpresented as a safer alternative for cancer treatment with a staggering number ofmolecular targets involved in tumor initiation , promotion , and progression.Despite being promising , its therapeutic potential is hindered due to itshydrophobic nature. Hence , the ongoing development of optimal delivery strategiesbased on nanotechnology , such as polymeric micelles (PMs) , to overcome issues inCUR solubilization and delivery to tumor cells. In this sense , this study aimedto optimize the development and stability of CUR-loaded P123:F127:TPGS PMs(PFT:CUR) based on the thin-film approach and evaluate their therapeuticpotential in CRC. Overall , the results revealed that the solubility of CUR wasimproved when room temperature was used to hydrate the film. The PFT-CUR hydratedat room temperature presents an average hydrodynamic diameter of 15.9 ± 0.3 nmwith a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.251 ± 0.103 and a zeta potential of -1.5 ±1.9 mV , and a 35.083 ± 1.144 encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and 3.217 ± 0.091drug loading (DL%) were observed. To ensure the stability of the optimizedPFT-CUR nanosystems , different lyophilization protocols were tested , the use of1% of glycine (GLY) being the most promising protocol. Regarding the criticalmicellar concentration (CMC) , it was shown that the cryoprotectant and thelyophilization process could impact it , with an increase from 0.064 mg/mL to0.119 mg/mL. In vitro results showed greater cytotoxic effects when CUR wasencapsulated compared to its free form , yet further analysis revealed theheightened cytotoxicity could be attributed to the system itself. Despitechallenges , the developed CUR-loaded PM shows potential as an effectivetherapeutic agent for CRC. Nonetheless , the system must undergo refinements toenhance drug entrapment as well as improve overall stability.

AB  - Because its long , tender pods supply essential proteins , vitamins , and fibers tohumans , yardlong bean (Vigna unguiculata ssp. sesquipedalis) is a commonlyconsumed vegetable , especially in Southeast Asia. To provide insights into thegenetic bases of key agricultural traits in yardlong bean , we here created ahigh-density bin-map with 2084 bin markers using 514 227 SNPs from arecombinant-inbred line (RIL) population. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mappingwas carried out to identify loci associated with anthocyanin content (ANT) ,vitamin E content (VE) , total soluble protein content (TSP) , pod length (PL) ,hundred-seed weight (HSW) , seed length and width (SL and SW , respectively) , andseed coat color (SCC). In total , 20 related QTLs were isolated , explaining7.58-56.03% of the phenotypic variation. Of these , five major QTLs (qANT5 ,qTSP11 , qVE7 , qPL3 , and qSCC9) were detected in 2020 , 2021 , and the combinedenvironment , explaining 11.96-56.03% of the phenotypic variation. VuANT1 wasidentified as a causal gene for the QTL qANT5 , which regulated anthocyanincontent; VuANT1 was highly expressed in immature purple pods but barelydetectable in white pods. VuANT1 overexpression in tobacco leaves and yardlongbean hairy roots resulted in purple coloration as a result of anthocyaninaccumulation. These findings suggested that VuANT1 was a key regulator ofanthocyanin accumulation in yardlong bean. Our results lay a firm foundation fortarget agricultural trait improvement and clarification of the genetic mechanismsunderlying agricultural traits in yardlong bean.

AB  - In recent years , great attention has been focused on rapid , selective , andenvironmentally friendly extraction methods to recover pigments and antioxidantsfrom microalgae. Among these , supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) represents oneof the most important alternatives to traditional extraction methods carried outwith the use of organic solvents. In this study , the influence of parameters suchas pressure , temperature , and the addition of a polar co-solvent in the SFEyields of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins from T. obliquus biomass wereevaluated. The highest extraction of alpha-tocopherol , gamma-tocopherol , andretinol was achieved at a pressure of 30 MPa and a temperature of 40 °C. It wasobserved that overall , the extraction yield increased considerably when apreliminary step of sample pre-treatment , based on a matrix solid phasedispersion , was applied using diatomaceous earth as a dispersing agent. The useof ethanol as a co-solvent , under certain conditions of pressure and temperature ,resulted in selectively increasing the yields of only some compounds. Inparticular , a remarkable selectivity was observed if the extraction was carriedout in the presence of ethanol at 10 MPa and 40 °C: under these conditions , itwas possible to isolate menaquinone-7 , a homologous of vitamin K2 , which ,otherwise , cannot not recovered by using traditional extraction procedures.

AB  - The extracellular polymer substances (EPS) generated by biofilms confersresistance to antimicrobial agents through electrostatic and steric interactionsthat hinder molecular diffusion. This resistance mechanism is particularlyevident for antibacterial nanomaterials , which inherently diffuse more slowlycompared to small organic antibacterial agents. The aim of this study was todetermine if a biofilm's resistance to antibacterial nanomaterial diffusion couldbe diminished using electrolytes to screen the EPS's electrostatic interactions.Anionic (+) alpha-tocopherol phosphate (α-TP) liposomes were used as theantimicrobial nanomaterials in the study. They self-assembled into 700 nm sizedstructures with a zeta potential of -20 mV that were capable of killing oralbacteria (S. oralis growth inhibition time of 3.34 ± 0.52 h). In a phosphate(-ve) buffer the -ve α-TP liposomes did not penetrate multispecies oral biofilms ,but in a Tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (+ve) buffer they did (depth -12.4 ± 3.6 μm). The Tris did not modify the surface charge of the α-TPnanomaterials , rather it facilitated the α-TP-biofilm interactions throughelectrolyte screening (Langmuir modelled surface pressure increase of2.7 ± 1.8 mN/ m). This data indicated that EPS resistance was mediated throughcharge repulsion and that this effect could be diminished through theco-administration of cationic electrolytes.
